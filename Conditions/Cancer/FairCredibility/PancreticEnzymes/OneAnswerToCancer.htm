</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">To those of you who are plagued with 
serious questions and demand answers, you will be eternally indebted to 
Bonnie O’Sullivan. She is the editor of this 1999 edition of <i>One Answer To Cancer</i>.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Bonnie has addressed the editing of this book with a 
desire to get truthful, correct, intelligent and honest answers to the 
multitude of questions that have gone unanswered during her 37 years of 
diligent study and work within the health seeking community.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">She has searched through all the collections of 
documents about the Kelley Metabolic Medicine’s Paradigm that she could 
find from Kansas, Texas, Washington, Pennsylvania, California, and 
Georgia and everywhere in-between to give you the answers you need and 
desire.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Bonnie attacked this task with her whole being and, 
like the proverbial pit bull with lockjaw, would not let go until all 
your questions were adequately answered. </p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">That which you are about to read may change your life forever.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When I was 11 years old, my brother Scott was 
diagnosed with terminal cancer; he was 20 at the time. His story is 
unique because he was one of the 150,000 individuals lucky enough to 
find Dr. Kelley’s book, <b><i>One Answer To Cancer</i></b>,<b><i><font size="4"> </font></i></b>and
 one of the only 33,000 to actually go on the program. Today, in 1997, 
he is healthy, cancer-free and living in California with his wife and 
three children. Scott’s experience changed the lives of each member of 
our family.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For me, the effect appeared when I was older. Around 
the age of 19, I began to experiment with various diets. I would 
cross-reference my overall sense of energy and my performances in 
running 10 kilometers to the diets I used, always allowing at least 90 
days between any changes. What I found should come as no surprise to 
anyone: When I consumed a largely uncooked vegetarian diet, eliminated 
alcohol consumption and drank plenty of fresh squeezed juices, my 10K 
running times and subsequent recovery periods were shorter than when I 
used a diet of more meat and cooked foods. In other words, my body 
worked better on simple fuels from nature.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For the greatest majority of us, we are born in 
perfect health. Our health and aging process after birth is largely 
influenced by genetics, culture, geography and, of course, the foods and
 liquids we consume. These things are all that distinguish who will grow
 to be strong and who will grow weak. Why is it some people can live 
lives of smoking and poor diet and live to be 90 and others are 
susceptible to ill health and disease while living a relatively healthy 
lifestyle? The fact is, regardless of outward physical appearance some 
people will become cancer victims and some apparently likely candidates 
won’t. It is simply human nature that some bodies are innately stronger 
and more resistant than others are. As adult individuals we have only 
one variable which is in our total control: Our diets.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The difference in lifestyle that you have led and 
your ancestry three generations removed is remarkable. We live in a 
world where air pollution is a daily occurrence; we work in jobs that 
are demanding in time, tolerance and ability to change and adapt. We 
struggle to balance our career, family, spiritual, emotional and social 
lives, and, yet as a society we have largely failed to intelligently 
consider the fuel which runs this remarkable human body. Fuels that 
provide peak performance and keep our internal operating systems running
 properly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When we are young, we feel invincible, immortal. Some
 of us develop habits and patterns in early adult life that prove 
detrimental later on. We eat too much dead food, drink too much alcohol,
 smoke cigarettes and take prescription drugs for any little perceived 
ill — all the while wrongly trusting that the regulatory bodies of 
society will look out for our health.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Well, let me tell you, in the words of a great songwriter: "I read the news today — oh boy."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Against the advice of leading doctors and scientists 
across the country, FDA commissioner Dr. Kessler approved the fat 
substitute ‘Olestra’ for public consumption. Doctors across the country 
from John Hopkins to Harvard Medical warned against the possible 
fall-out from introducing this synthetic fat into the American diet for 
reasons which have been well published in the media, (see Appendix II). 
Interestingly most of the warning comes from the academic side of the 
medical science community. Why do you suppose that is? I’ll tell you . .
 .</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I have believed for a long time that the American 
Medical Complex and the Consumer Food and Beverage Industrial Complex 
have little interest in the prevention of disease. It makes far better 
business sense to let the population eat, drink and smoke to their 
heart’s content and then offer seemingly high tech and expensive methods
 for cleaning up the aftermath. In the United States, the food industry 
alone generates 500 billion dollars in sales: Bacon, eggs, milk, fast 
food franchises, soft drinks, fried food, dead food, overcooked food, 
sweets, treats and canned goods. We have gotten away from simple diets 
and become human garbage disposals. Sixty percent of the American public
 is overweight. Clearly the large food conglomerates are successfully 
marketing to an oblivious public. After feeding your body with dead and 
processed foods for 20, 30, 40 or more years, things begin to run less 
perfectly. We have overlooked the processing energy required to digest 
bacon and eggs each morning, that steak in the evening and the cocktails
 in between. The result is the current health crisis where one in three 
will have cancer in their lifetimes — not to mention heart disease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">But instead of educating the public on how our bodies
 function best, the medical establishment chooses instead to clean out 
those arteries with drugs and catheters, perform by-pass surgery or cut 
the problem out (or off) altogether. To be fair, the American medical 
community has done some wonderful things and made outstanding progress 
in the last 45 years. But it is simply not in their best interest to 
prevent disease. They are in the business of treating disease. This is 
where the money is: Surgery, MRI, radiation, chemotherapy, research and 
examinations. The doctors don’t want a disease-fee society any more than
 lawyers want a perfectly honest one.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This booklet is intended to provide an alternative 
view to conventional medicine in regard to 20th Century disease — to 
profess prevention in healthy people and educate those who are ill. The 
human body is the most incredible of discoveries. Perhaps it receives so
 little consideration because we all get one upon entering into this 
life. We take it for granted until it cries out to us. Read this book 
and incorporate everything in it you can into your lifestyle. Listen to 
your heart and the voice within you and seek the advice of a trusted 
physician. On that note, a word of caution: There are doctors who hold 
Dr. Kelley in high esteem and those who see him as a threat. Be prepared
 to encounter one or the other. The open-minded ones tend to be the 
former.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Finally Dr. Kelley was aggressively persecuted and 
oppressed during his years of treating cancer patients. His success was 
unparalleled in conventional medicine. Personally, both my brother and 
my chiropractor went to him; both were resolved of their disease. Dr. 
Kelley has been forbidden to advise cancer victims and this book must 
carry with it a warning to all, that it is not intended to be a cure, 
but rather a program to be used in conjunction with the guidance of your
 own physician for the resolution of degenerative disease. As the writer
 of this preface, I can say that the truth of Dr. Kelly’s paradigm is 
both preventive and healing. I wish you God’s speed and hope that the 
truth will set you free. </p>

<p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc434239825">*Foreword*</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Health is a wonderful possession. It does 
not last forever — although most of us assume it will. It is not until 
we lose our health that we seek diligently to regain it. Often it is too
 late, and always too expensive.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is the purpose of the Cancer Coalition to help 
those who desire better health and who are willing to work for their 
better health. It is ever the objective of The Cancer Coalition to point
 out the metabolic deficiencies in the metabolism of each person who has
 the malfunction, not to treat the disease who has the person.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is our desire to advise, teach, and counsel a 
person in such a way that he and he alone is responsible for his or her 
health. A doctor cannot "cure" you of anything. If you have a broken 
arm, the physician may set it — but only you — your own body — may 
"cure" or heal the break. Of course, during your lifetime you will need 
the help of many in the healing professions: The dentist, the osteopath,
 the chiropractor, the naturopath, the biochemist, the nutritionist, the
 therapist, and last, but not least, the spiritual counselor.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Although these may give you aid, you must assume the responsibility of accepting and following their advice.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In researching some of the more complex disease 
processes, it became more and more evident to us that cancer is a simple
 deficiency condition. We have proven this to our own satisfaction, and 
to the satisfaction of many counselees.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This publication is a simplified, condensed, 
practical application of our investigations and findings. We present 
these findings because there have been so many prayers unto God for a 
solution to this simple problem.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To successfully resolve cancer, however simple, is a 
tedious and lengthy metabolic process. It is not expensive as compared 
to the "accepted" surgical, radiological, or chemotherapy methods, and 
has proven very effective.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is our desire that this booklet be a helpful aid 
to many who are themselves or have lost loved ones afflicted with 
malignancy.</p>

</font></b><i><p align="JUSTIFY">A comprehensive defense program must 
recognize the existence of more than one potential enemy. Metabolic 
Medicine can handle other enemies besides cancer. It is, in fact, a 
lifestyle for peace or war — one that can keep you in an ideal state of 
readiness.</p>
</i><p align="JUSTIFY">Over the last 30 years or so, the medical 
profession and the medical community have progressed to unprecedented 
heights and achievements in areas of reconstruction and surgical 
procedure. They have worked hard and deserve every bit of the respect 
and honor they receive. They have done remarkably well in applying 
technological advances to their profession.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The medical community has centered its energies and 
advancement around the infectious and traumatic cases. It has all but 
conquered infections of all types. Surgical procedures and treatment of 
traumatic ills have advanced equally with control of the infectious 
diseases. In short, what the medical community does, it does well, 
unsurpassed in the history of mankind.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">But the problems for which the medical community is 
so well trained and equipped to handle account for only a percentage of 
the illnesses in our society. In the balance of the cases involving 
degeneration or metabolic conditions, little hope is received.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Down through the years, cancer patients have had such
 excellent results with Metabolic Medicine that they have brought other 
family members and friends for nutritional counseling. The range of 
diseases for which Dr. Kelley has planned nutritional programs covers 
the complete gamut of degenerative and metabolic ills, even some 
infectious diseases and structural conditions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley distinguishes between degenerative disease
 and metabolic disease in this example: Adult-onset diabetes is 
degenerative; childhood-onset diabetes is metabolic. Metabolic diseases 
can result from improper nutrition to the fetus due to the faulty diet 
of the mother during pregnancy. (It is widely recognized among medical 
authorities that birth defects have risen dramatically in recent years.)
 Metabolic disease can result from injury or other trauma. Metabolic 
diseases are those which do not result from long-term physical 
degeneration.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Dr. Kelley’s experience with over 33,000 benefactors
 led or leads him to believe that balancing body chemistry through 
nutrition is a fruitful approach which should be investigated on a 
larger scale. How long this will take, or whether it will be done at 
all, is a matter of speculation. Many readers, or their friends, are 
desperately seeking help for conditions that could be alleviated through
 nutritional balancing of body chemistry. Cancer is just one of these 
conditions. A large part of Dr. Kelley’s Nutritional Counseling is 
devoted to planning nutritional programs for people who do not have 
cancer. Whatever the specific metabolic-degenerative condition may be, 
hope and encouragement is justified by the many favorable reports from 
those who have already benefited from Metabolic Medicine.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Cancer is a term used to classify a fast growing malignant tumor, which, if allowed to grow unchecked, will cause death. </p>
<p>Many clinicians have the mistaken belief that cancer is complex; a 
number of different diseases, each having its own cause. Nothing could 
be further from the truth. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Most doctors, even the research scientists, suppose 
such things as viruses, X-rays, cigarette smoking, chemicals, sunlight, 
trauma, etc. cause cancer. These, sometimes, are an indirect cause.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362434"></a><a name="_Toc430363741"></a><a name="_Toc434239832">The Direct Cause of Cancer is The Changing of an Ectopic<br>
Germ Cell into an Ectopic Trophoblast Cell</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The direct cause of cancer, according to 
our research, is the changing of an ectopic germ cell into an ectopic 
trophoblast cell. An excess of female sex hormones brings about this 
change. Both men and women have male and female sex hormones. When this 
delicate male-female sex hormone balance is upset, cancer may start.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Let me explain this a little further. In the human 
life cycle, the male sperm unites with the female egg. Now if this 
fertilized egg would grow directly into a new baby, we would have no 
cancer or cancer problems, but nature does not act so simply and 
directly, for if she did, the newly formed embryo (baby) would fall out 
of the uterus. Therefore, nature had to develop some way to attach the 
new embryo to the wall of the uterus and some way to nourish (feed) it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After the sperm in the fallopian tube of the mother 
fertilizes the egg the fertilized egg gives rise to three basic kinds of
 cells:</p>
<ol>

<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Primitive germ cells</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Normal body or somatic cells</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Trophoblast cells </li><p></p></ol>
</ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">	By the third day the fertilized egg has fallen into 
the uterus. During those three days and for many days thereafter, the 
trophoblast cells (cancer cells) are growing very rapidly and surround 
the other two types of cells (primitive germ cells, and normal body or 
somatic cells). </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The new baby will fall out of the uterus unless 
something happens fast, and happen it does. The trophoblast cells 
metastasize (as cancer does) to the wall of the uterus. Now the baby 
cannot fall out of the mother’s uterus, but needs nourishment. The 
trophoblast cells (cancer cells) continue to grow rapidly and form the 
placenta. Now with a good food supply and no danger of falling out of 
the mother, the baby (embryo) can continue to grow, safe and sound, 
until birth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The placental trophoblast tissue (cancer mass) continues to grow until about the seventh week when the baby’s pancreas develops.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The baby’s pancreatic enzyme production along with 
the mother’s pancreatic enzyme production stops the growth of the 
placental trophoblastic tissue.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As the new embryo (baby) is being formed from the 
normal body or somatic cells, the primitive germ cells (pre-placenta 
cells) are multiplying. In a few days, when the embryo (baby) develops 
to the proper stage, the primitive germ cells stop multiplying and begin
 to migrate to the gonads (ovaries or testes).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are about three billion of these primitive germ
 cells that fatigue and never have the vital force necessary to reach 
the gonads. This means that there are two germ cells for every area the 
size of a pinhead dispersed throughout your body. Any one of these germ 
cells is a potential cancer. That is why cancer can form in any part of 
the body. All that is needed to create cancer in our body is a 
deficiency of pancreatic enzymes, an imbalance of sex hormones and the 
embryonic destiny of a basic germ cell to form a placenta in preparation
 for the creation of a baby. The imbalance of sex hormones can take 
place at any time, but usually it occurs between 45 and 60 years of age.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When all is said and done, cancer is a normal growth 
of tissue (a placenta) due to the development of a basic germ cell in 
the wrong place (outside of the uterus). Sometimes this placenta also 
has a "baby" or begins a tumor inside of it much like a normal pregnancy
 — only it is in the wrong place. (When dissecting tumors Pathologists 
often find partially formed teeth, toenails and other types of tissue, 
such as lung tissue, within the tumors.)   </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Malignancy, therefore, is never normal (somatic) 
tissue gone into wild proliferation, but a normal primitive germ cell 
growing normally in the wrong place.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">I would like to share with you my concept 
of the physiology of cancer. In order for you to comprehend my concept 
let me give you a little background by reviewing with you Pellagra and 
Diabetes.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362436"></a><a name="_Toc430363743"></a><a name="_Toc434239834">Pellagra Can Be Controlled With<br>
A Diet Containing B Vitamins</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">For years patients were placed in insane 
asylums because they had the simple deficiency disease called Pellagra. 
In 1916 Dr. Joseph Goldberger found that diet could prevent this 
condition, but it was not until the 1940’s that it was discovered that 
Pellegra was nothing more than a simple B vitamin deficiency. Now no 
knowledgeable physician would commit such a patient, but rather give him
 B vitamins.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What is Pellagra? It is a symptom of a general 
systemic condition. For centuries only the symptoms were treated — now 
we know better.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362437"></a><a name="_Toc430363744"></a><a name="_Toc434239835">Diabetes Can Be Controlled By<br>
Diet, Insulin, or a Combination of Both</a> </p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">What is diabetes? It is nothing more than a
 symptom. It is a symptom that tells us that our systemic carbohydrate 
(sugar) metabolism is not functioning properly. Before insulin the great
 physicians stood by and wrung their hands helplessly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Before the discovery of insulin by professor Ernest 
L. Scott in 1911 and until the early 1930’s, when a person was diagnosed
 as having diabetes, they would often ask the doctor if their condition 
could be helped or made worse by what they were eating and should they 
change their diet in any way? The doctor would tell them: "Oh no, diet 
doesn’t make any difference — eat anything you want, you aren’t going to
 live much longer anyway, so live it up and eat whatever you want." 
Doctors couldn’t connect the diet and diabetes. Even lay people in those
 days figured out that if you ate a lot of leafy green vegetables and 
reduced the amount of sugar you took in, you survived longer and did 
well — at least better than the person who didn’t watch his diet.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">And so it was that after the development of insulin, doctors figured out that there <i>is</i>
 a factor in diet. In the early 1920s there weren’t very good analytical
 facilities available. But the doctors empirically found that the people
 who ate green leafy vegetables, and a few other foods, survived 
diabetes much better and the sugar count in their urine was much better.
 They had a saying in the medical community at that time that leafy, 
green vegetables contained "natural insulin." It wasn’t actually the 
truth, but they became aware of the fact that including these vegetables
 in the diet did play a role and they were trying to explain it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We’re in the same situation now with cancer. Someday,
 in the near future, it will dawn on the medical community that diet 
does make quite a difference in people with cancer, and greatly affects 
health in general. It can’t happen too soon. When it does, a lot of 
lives will be saved and a lot of lives will be lived more healthfully.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">At least 86% of all cancer conditions could be adequately treated and/or prevented by diet and pancreatic enzymes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Cancer is a symptom of inadequate and deficient 
protein metabolism. The real problem is protein metabolism, not cancer. 
Cancer is only a symptom telling those who would listen that their 
protein metabolism is in very serious trouble. Surgery, radiation and 
chemotherapy only treat the symptoms of cancer. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One hundred years ago Dr. John Beard at the 
University of Edinburgh discovered that the body’s primary mechanism for
 destroying cancer is contained in pancreatin, a secretion from the 
pancreas that includes enzymes for digesting protein (among other 
things). Enzymes digest or liquefy foods for absorption by the body. Dr.
 Beard presented pictures in his books and papers to show recoveries 
using pancreatin. This was an unprecedented approach to treating the 
symptoms of cancer — a direct attack on the malignancy with a substance 
that did not have toxic side effects on the other functions of the body.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Howard Beard (no relation) of Fort Worth, Texas 
has contributed considerably to the understanding and use of pancreatic 
enzymes in the treatment of cancer. He and other researchers indicated 
that where cancer is concerned trypsin and particularly chymotrypsin are
 the important enzymes in pancreatin. Dr. Beard also recommended a 
nutritional program and other things, as stated in his book: <i>A New Approach to Cancer, Rheumatic, and Heart Diseases.</i></p><i>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The stimulating presence of the female sex hormones</li><p></p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Our research indicates that in 93% of all 
cancer cases the development of cancer is gradual. The average cancer 
patient has had cancer 39 months before it is clinically diagnosed. The 
important factor here is <b><i>not</i></b> that it is slow growing, but 
rather what happens to the body during this growth time — the body must 
have protein to live, but during this 39 months the body could not get 
enough protein from its food supply. Therefore, to keep the blood 
protein at a minimal level to sustain life, the body very gradually saps
 or destroys the muscles of the body. </p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362445"></a><a name="_Toc430363752"></a><a name="_Toc434239843">Third Law:</a></p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">At this point the conditions are ripe for 
the symptom cancer to develop. All that is needed is something to 
stimulate the female sex hormone formation at the site of a misplaced 
ectopic germ cell. This is most often done by scar formation caused by a
 blow, a bruise, a drop of tar in the lung, a sun burn, an overdose of 
X-ray, or anything else that can cause a normal scar formation procedure
 to take place in the body — at the site of a latent ectopic germ cell. 
This is normal wear and tear of the body, which happens to each of us 
every day; it is only when our protein metabolism is deficient that the 
symptom cancer develops.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Now the ectopic germ cell mistakenly thinks it is 
time to have a baby and starts growing a placenta (cancer) in 
preparation for a baby that never develops. The only trouble is, without
 proper amounts of pancreatic enzymes circulating in our bloodstream to 
dissolve this abnormal placenta, it keeps growing and does not stop. 
When the patient finally consults the physician the condition of cancer 
is announced and surgery, radiation and chemotherapy are recommended.</p>

the patient, the cancer grows until it destroys the body. If something

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">"Metabolic" pertains to metabolism: The 
chemical and physical processes continuously going on in living 
organisms and cells, comprising those by which assimilated food is built
 up (anabolism) into protoplasm and those by which protoplasm is used 
and broken down (catabolism) into simpler substances or waste matter, 
with the release of energy for all vital processes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The person who has the metabolic malfunction should 
be addressed, not the disease that has the person. We call our system of
 addressing cancer "Metabolic" because the total person and all of his 
chemical and physical processes must be considered, and new habits of 
health developed in order to obtain a reasonable state of health.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We advise a very comprehensive program. It is 
extremely effective and inexpensive when compared to surgery, radiation 
and chemotherapy. Those who are willing to faithfully and tediously 
follow it will be successful. Those who follow it in part or haphazardly
 will be completely unsuccessful.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure Program is based on 
the best scientific knowledge available and has been condensed to a 
simple well-balanced system. Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure Program 
can be compared to a fine watch; each part must be there and be working 
properly or it does not work at all. Each step of Metabolic Medicine’s 
Cancer Cure Program must be followed exactly or there will not be any 
relief of the symptoms.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362450"></a><a name="_Toc430363757"></a><a name="_Toc434239848">The Five Steps of Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure Program:</a></p>
</font></b><font size="5"></font><ol><font size="5"><b>

</b></font><ol><font size="5"><b>

</b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Metabolic Supplementation (Chapter III)</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Detoxification Of The Body (Chapter IV)</li><p></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Spiritual Attitude	(Chapter VII)</li><p></p></ol>
</ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Step one, halting or stopping the malignant growth 
with the use of supplemental metabolic nutrition, is relatively simple. 
The growth is usually stopped from within 3 hours to 12 days of 
metabolic nutritional supplementation, depending upon the amount and 
method of administration. This is usually noted by a sharp elevation of 
body temperature lasting about 3 days. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The clinical problem in treating a cancer patient is 
step two, clearing the body of accumulated toxins. This takes from 3 
weeks to 12 months, depending upon the location and mass (amount) of 
growth. Many cancer patients have had their tumors successfully treated 
only to die of toxic poisons as the mass is dissolved and excreted from 
the body — in a case such as this the clinician treated the disease and 
not the patient, or failed to treat "metabolically."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We find that the rate of recovery is subject to 
another law — that of blood supply. If the rate of blood supply to an 
area is great, recovery is fast. If the blood supply to an area is 
inadequate, recovery is very slow. Thus, we find those with leukemia 
respond quickly, while those with bone afflictions have a much slower 
response. We have also noted that in tumors of large diameter (three or 
more inches) the outside diameter is quickly dissolved, but the 
interior, where there is a lack of blood supply, often takes several 
months to dissolve. This is a very wonderful thing: the body has time to
 detoxify and the death rate from toxemia is greatly reduced.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The prognosis for a cancer patient is very good when 
the liver, kidney, and lung functions are at least 50% of normal, and an
 optimistic spiritual attitude is maintained. Unfortunately, we have 
found many people who have lost hope, or their next of kin have lost 
hope, to the degree they were resigned to death and refused to try our

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">There are many causes for the failure of 
our pancreatic metabolic function. Often more than one cause exists 
simultaneously within the cancer patient. Listed below are some of these
 and all must be considered as possible or ruled out as non-causative in
 each cancer patient:</p>
<ol>

<ol>

<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>The pancreas </b>fails to produce an adequate quantity of enzymes.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>We take</b> into our bodies such 
large quantities of foods, which require pancreatic enzymes for their 
digestion, that there are no enzymes available for cancer digestion.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>Diet:</b> Incorrect type, amount, and timing of nutritional intake.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>Nutritional Components </b>are not available (vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc.) that are necessary for normal metabolism within the pancreas.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>We may fail</b> to take into our diet enough minerals, which are essential to release the	enzymes into activity.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>We may produce</b> enough enzymes but we fail to take into our diet enough coenzymes (vitamins) to make the enzymes work.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>Failure of the Small Intestine</b> to make adequate pancreatic activators.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>Obstruction </b>of pancreatic secretion flow.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>Often</b> we produce enough enzymes, but the blood supply to a cancer area is so poor the enzymes we produce are not carried to the area.</li><p></p>
<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>Proper pH Balance </b>(acid/alkaline balance) within the intestinal tract and/or within the cancer tumor mass.</li><p></p>
<b><u><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></u></b><li><b><u>Infection</u>:</b> Bacterial or viral.</li><p></p>

<b><p align="JUSTIFY"></p></b><li><b>Non-Absorption </b>of pancreatic 
secretions (pancreatin) from the intestines into the body due to 
scarring or damage to the small intestine from various diseases.</li><p></p>

particular, the Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Scandinavian, Germanic, French, 
Scottish, Irish and British peoples, genetically appear to have a much

 Blacks, Asians and mixed races have a much lower incidence of cancer

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Each day each one of us has a "Cancer" 
start and develop in our body. This is a normal ongoing process each one
 of us experiences. Usually, our normal metabolic defense system takes 
care of these wayward cancer cells and we go about our daily lives 
unaware that any of this is taking place. It is when our normal 
metabolic defense system or clean-up crew cannot handle this normal body
 process that we begin to develop a tumor or mass which can eventually 
be found by ourselves or our physician. Before this happens, you can 
easily determine the failure of your defense system and the beginning of
 "Cancer" — Malignant Tumor Masses — by using the following simple 
Pancreas Self-Examination.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362460"></a><a name="_Toc430363767"></a><a name="_Toc434239857">Dr. Kelley’s Self-Examination Procedure</a></p>
</font></b><i><p align="JUSTIFY">There are only three who care about you: God, yourself and sometimes your mother. </p>
</i><p align="JUSTIFY">The Establishment has finally come to strongly 
encourage all of us to practice self-examination for Cancer. Women are 
told to examine their breasts once a month. All of us are told to 
carefully examine for lumps and bumps and skin changes. This helps us 
become aware of our body and seek medical care early if needed. We have 
had, from the first publication of this book in 1967, the 
self-examination for the earliest possible development of pancreatic 
malfunction. When this occurs, within 2 to 4 years one always develops a
 Malignant Tumor Mass, which the Medical Community, in error, labels 
Cancer. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">You give yourself control with Dr. Kelley’s 
Self-Examination Procedure of one’s pancreas. If one finds one’s 
pancreatic malfunction in time to properly treat it, one will have to do
 it for  one’s self. Dr. Kelley’s Self-Examination of one’s pancreas 
finds pancreas malfunction long before Malignant Tumor Masses form. You 
have the greatest to gain by self-examination. God gives one the 
intelligence and self will to do this if one’s mother (family or 
friends) does not interfere.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Self-Examination Procedure below should be the 
most important part of your health program. This procedure only 
indicates the activity of one’s pancreas — it is not a diagnostic test. 
It only alerts one very early to the possible formation of Malignant 
Tumor Masses. Thus, you can run to your physician for proper and legal 
diagnosis and treatment if needed. This procedure is the most sensitive 
and early awareness system known to date. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley’s Self-Examination Procedure is nothing 
more than early self-detection and/or an early warning of the decrease 
of pancreatic production of adequate pancreatic enzymes. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When the pancreas is not working properly and fails to produce adequate amounts of enzymes the following occurs: </p>
<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The first indication of pancreatic failure is indigestion with belching and passing of excessive gas (flatulence). </li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The second indication over an extended time is the dental condition called pyorrhea. </li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The third indication is focusing problems of 
the eyes. This occurs because the muscles of the eyes are so tiny it 
doesn’t take much protein loss to interfere with their function; a tiny 
little bit of eye muscle makes a big difference. (Dr. Kelley is still 
able to read without glasses at the age of 73 — and he uses the same 
pair of glasses to drive as he used in 1963. See his story, "30-Year 
Victory Over Pancreatic/Liver Cancer" on page 111.)</li><p></p></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley correctly calls such conditions pancreatic
 failure, and within two to four years normal trophoblast cells (false 
placenta cells) will develop into Malignant Tumor Masses or lymph and 
blood dysfunction.	</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As stated elsewhere in this book, the disease 
commonly referred to as "Cancer" by the Medical Community is nothing 
more than the failure of one’s pancreas to produce adequate enzymes to 
properly digest one’s food intake and clean-up the defective, worn-out 
and dead cells throughout one’s body.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">It is our belief that each one of us has 
the right to build and maintain a healthy body, mind and spirit by 
properly addressing pancreas failure by taking adequate, effective 
pancreatic enzyme supplements by mouth as outlined in Chapter III. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Pancreas Self-Examination below should be the 
most important part of your cancer prevention regime. This Pancreas 
Self-Examination only indicates the function or 
"failure-to-function-properly" of one’s pancreas. This procedure is the 
most sensitive evaluation and early awareness system known to date. It 
determines the status, condition and activity of one’s pancreatic enzyme
 production. Dr. Kelley’s Pancreas Self-Examination Procedure should be 
done every 12 to 18 months. 	</p>

</font></b><font size="5"></font><ol type="A"><font size="5"><b>

</b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>If within six weeks on the 
Pancreas Self-Examination one becomes toxic, ill, crabby, sick, 
nauseated, vomits, or develops an elevation of temperature or violent 
headache, a malignant tumor mass of placenta cells could possibly be 
present of a size that should be detectable by one’s physician.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>If within six weeks on the Pancreas 
Self-Examination one feels better, has better digestion, with more 
energy and stamina, one is usually pre-cancerous. That is, one’s 
pancreas is not quite able to meet the demands of digestion and the 
normal clean-up activity needs of one’s body. In this case, it is highly
 likely one will develop a malignant placenta tumor mass within two to 
four years.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If one is pre-cancerous it is suggested one should 
take two or three Formula P caplets with meals and at bedtime the rest 
of one’s life — or until one wants to have a "Cancer Party" at his or 
her local hospital. Of course, if you are rich enough you could have 
your "Cancer Party" in Houston, Texas at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, or
 rush off to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota or Stanford in California.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>If, after five or six weeks on the Pancreas 
Self-Examination one does not notice a toxic feeling or condition nor 
does one feel better, one’s pancreas is probably producing adequate 
pancreatic enzymes and it is unlikely a malignant placenta tumor mass is
 forming. One should repeat the Pancreas Self-Test again every 12 to 18 
months.</li><p></p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">By the time one’s body forms a malignant 
placenta tumor mass, which is in error called cancer, one becomes 
frightened. One’s physician also becomes frightened and the only things 
he or she knows to do, and is permitted to do to address the malignant 
placenta tumor mass, are Surgery, Radiation and Chemotherapy. Addressing
 these malignant placenta tumor masses is absolutely necessary in most 
cases. However, if one does not properly address the <i>cause</i> of 
one’s cancer, these and other malignant placenta tumor masses will 
return in a few months even larger and more vicious and life 
threatening.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Before, during and after your physician treats these 
malignant placenta tumor masses one should address the cause of one’s 
cancer — that is, the failure of the pancreas. As outlined in Chapter 
III, metabolically supporting one’s failing pancreas is absolutely 
necessary to properly address one’s cancer and to help prevent the 
reoccurrence of additional malignant placenta tumor masses.</p>

 is the true teaching behind this beautiful saying? What was Jesus

Nothing could be further from the truth. No matter how many years a 
doctor has gone to school, no matter how many college degrees he or she 
may have, a doctor can cure only one person — himself or herself. It is 
important that you understand that only <u>you</u><b> </b>can cure you of anything.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is you and your body chemistry that cures you of 
your disease. In doing this you must take note that you are 
environmental, physical, mental and spiritual — each facet plays a part

The University of Pennsylvania for 12 years; ABIM Certified Diplomat in 
Internal Medicine; ABIM Certified Diplomat Cardiovascular Disease; 
Diplomat of National Board of Medical Examiners) and I spent 10 years in
 undivided attention to bring the Truth to you. We reviewed thousands of
 medical records of Cancer patients. We spent hundreds of hours in 
Medical School Libraries. We spent thousands of hours in University Law 
Libraries. We brought many legal cases in the State and Federal Courts 
of Pennsylvania. We appealed to the 3rd Circuit of the Federal Courts 
several times and appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court 5 times. During 
this time Dr. Morrison and I collected more than adequate data and 
endured sufficient experiences to honestly and with Christian love for 
our fellow Cancer patients, and without rancor, make the following 
statements. To put it candidly, we know whereof we speak and write. (See
 below and take note in Chapter X.)</p>
<p>Dr. Morrison and I were desperately working within the Legal System 
and Medical Establishment to be permitted to use Metabolic Medicine’s 
Cancer Cure to help those who chose to use this proven therapeutic 
procedure. For years, the Medical Establishment, without investigation 
said, "It couldn’t be "The Cancer Cure" — Dr. Kelley is a dentist."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Morrison was of a different mind. She is one of 
the most outstanding physicians in the United States, Board Certified in
 Cardiology and Internal Medicine, has taken advanced training with 
Queen Elizabeth’s Physicians and taught at the University of 
Pennsylvania Medical School.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I know our opinions about the Medical Establishment 
are repulsive and unbelievable to the honest, God fearing, Christian 
citizen. Nevertheless, they are true and we have encountered so many 
such experiences we must bring to your attention at least one of these 
horrible stories.</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362469">Dr. Morrison’s Brother David</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">One day, Dr. Morrison got an urgent call 
from her little brother, David. He had a small lump, about the size of a
 pea, on the left side of his neck, just above the collarbone. His 
doctor in New Jersey, knowing the stress David was under with his "wife 
to be" told him to just calm down and get his family situation resolved 
and watch it and check again in six months. On hearing this advice, 
David’s mother went into hysterics and brought David to Pittsburgh, 
where Carol was working in a local hospital. Their mother was somewhat 
justified as both David’s father and Carol had been diagnosed, by 
biopsy, as having cancer (Lung and Breast).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Carol knew from her medical training that if the lump
 was malignant it was only a metastasis of a tumor mass, usually found 
in the chest between the lungs. She asked me to ask the Holy Spirit for 
confirmation. I was told that, yes, the original malignant mass had been
 between the lungs, but the normal body defenses (clean-up crew) had 
completely cleared the primary site and the lump in the neck had been 
encapsulated into a fibrous nodule, and to leave it alone and get 
David’s love life settled and reduce his stress — the same advice his 
New Jersey doctor had given. To verify the Holy Spirit, Carol did a 
"scan" in the hospital where she was working. It was negative.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It was agreed to wait six months and then check David
 again. David’s mother, wanting to play doctor, as many unqualified 
people do, took David to Philadelphia to the medical school. She 
demanded the nodule be removed and biopsied to prove it was cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A very rich mother and David’s health Insurance 
policy was like waving a red flag in front of a bull in Mexico. If she 
demanded a diagnosis of cancer and could pay for it, "she will get it." 
And David was fair game to the Medical Con Artists.</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362470"></a><a name="_Toc430363775">*Second Opinion*</a></p>

enough and live on the East Coast, it’s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer 
Center in New York City; if you are rich enough and live in Texas, it’s 
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston; if you are rich enough and live 
in the central U.S., it’s The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota; if 
you are rich enough and live on the West Coast, it’s Stanford in 
California. Everyone gets a piece of the pie!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The advice of the New York doctors was: "The 
University of Pennsylvania uses exactly the same therapy as we do and 
could treat David as well as we do. We do see a swelling in the nasal 
sinus. It would be closer to home for David to be treated in 
Philadelphia and less stress."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Back in Philadelphia, mother demanded a biopsy of the
 nasal sinus; the fact that David had allergies was never considered. 
The surgery was a disaster; the surgeon ruptured a major artery and 
nearly killed David. No biopsy of a life or death situation was 
encountered. All manor of chemotherapy and radiation was then started.</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362471"></a><a name="_Toc430363776">*Third Opinion*</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">David’s mother heard (through the 
patient’s gossip hotline) of the newest procedure in Pittsburgh and 
announced: "We must have this "newest and best" for David." </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In Pittsburgh David was scalped; his skull was sawed 
from ear to ear and set aside. Seventeen biopsy samples were taken, 
digging as close to the brain as possible. His skull was replaced and 
his scalp sewed back over the bones; seventeen hours and $200,000 later 
David was wheeled out of the operating room.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">David was going to five doctors and each one was 
giving him something different and not knowing or caring what the others
 were treating him with. All this was accomplished and treatment 
performed when there was no positive biopsy ever reported. All they 
could say was: "It could be cancer, but we can’t find it in the biopsy."
 Mother was delighted; she got to play doctor along with the best of 
them, while she was relieved of part of her wealth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Morrison and I were devastated. We constantly 
asked God why such devastating and cruel experiences were necessary when
 David did not even have cancer! Maybe it was for you, the readers of 
this booklet — for your education and understanding. Carol and I had 
seen enough, long before David.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">In reality, a person very rarely dies of 
cancer. It is always starvation and toxicity. As the malignant tumor 
grows it gives off waste products, which must be eliminated through the 
colon, liver, kidneys, lungs and skin. These waste products accumulate 
and gradually overburden the body. Most persons then die of toxemia.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Before any disease can be cured, the waste products 
and impurities must be cleansed from the body. The sooner this is done, 
the sooner the body can begin repairing itself. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley recommends that you begin the 
detoxification process even before you have the nutritional supplements 
in your possession. It is absolutely imperative that the patient 
carefully follows the detoxification process after the supplements begin
 stimulating the release of wastes and debris.	</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Scientists have calculated that a person has between 
70 and 100 trillion cells in his or her body. This means we have over 70
 trillion "garbage cans" needing to be emptied. In our culture we have 
not made allowances for, nor taught ourselves, the proper techniques of 
emptying these waste receptacles. It is no wonder that the people of our
 nation are so sick! Proper and thorough detoxification is just as 
important as good nutrition for anyone who has lived in the mainstream 
of a modern technological civilization for 10 or more years, and 
especially for anyone who has developed symptoms of a chronic 
degenerative disease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The intensive program of concentrated nutrients 
outlined in this book will begin to make nutritional factors available 
to the cells, which they may not have had for many years. Consequently, 
cellular metabolism will speed up and an increased amount of metabolic 
waste will be dumped into the bloodstream. Most people’s organs of 
elimination do not function well enough to handle this increase in 
waste. If it accumulates in the bloodstream, one will not feel well and 
the cells will not be able to utilize the fresh nutrients being provided
 by the nutritional program. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When one eats food, it is digested in the mouth, 
stomach, and intestinal tract. In the intestinal tract, the digested 
food is absorbed into the bloodstream, which takes it close to each 
individual cell. The food, along with oxygen, is transferred into the 
cell. In the cell, nutrients are metabolized into energy, carbon 
dioxide, water, and waste products of metabolism. It is the accumulation
 of these wastes, which frequently interferes with normal functions of 
the cells.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Principle factors necessary for a pure bloodstream 
are pure air, pure water, pure food, and the presence of oxygen brought 
in by exercise appropriate to your cardiovascular capacity. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As the cells produce metabolic debris, the blood 
carries it to the organs of detoxification. These organs are the liver, 
kidneys, lungs, skin, many of the mucous membranes, and the colon. If 
these organs of detoxification are themselves filled with debris, they 
of course cannot accept any more toxins. In such a case, the blood 
cannot accept further debris from the cells and, before long, there are 
70 to 100 trillion garbage cans completely full. It is like the city 
dump being filled to capacity and not accepting any more garbage trucks.
 Then one’s home becomes overloaded with garbage, which shortly 
interferes with normal functions of one’s household. Before long, the 
entire community has become bogged down. "Clean blood" then, acting as a
 highway for the garbage trucks, is dependent upon the organs of 
detoxification.  </p>
<b><font size="6"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc434239883">The Master Gland of Detoxification</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The liver is the major organ of 
detoxification, and also the most stressed by our modern lifestyle. One 
cannot live long without the heart, brain, kidneys, or pancreas, yet it 
is proper liver function, which prevents these organs from becoming 
diseased. Here, in addition to metabolic wastes, is where environmental 
contamination, food additives, and all other chemical pollutants are 
removed from the body. You should be just as much or more concerned 
about the condition of your liver as about the condition of your heart. 
If you have had hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, infectious 
mononucleosis, or other liver damage, you should become very protective 
of this vital organ. The intake of anything that places undue stress on 
the liver should be eliminated entirely. Such a list would include: 
chemicals of any kind; drugs; synthetic foods; artificial food 
additives, such as flavorings, colorings, preservatives, emulsifiers, 
stabilizers, sweeteners; alcoholic beverages; carbonated beverages; hair
 sprays; chemical deodorants; and reheated vegetable oils used in 
frying, commercial pastries, and most fast foods. (Unrefined oils, or 
butter for sautéing, can be used without creating peroxides and free 
radicals, which are toxic to the liver.)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Major functions of this incredibly complex organ include:</p>

<ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Metabolizing essential fats (cholesterol, 
triglycerides, lipoproteins) and thus preventing their accumulation in 
the bloodstream where they often form deposits on blood vessel walls 
(atherosclerosis).</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Synthesizing the bulk of necessary blood proteins.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Breaking down and eliminating most drugs and environmental poisons.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Secreting a fluid (bile) which stores in the gall bladder or the enlarged bile duct and empties into the small intestine.</li><p></p></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The bile acts as a carrier for all liver wastes. It 
is also essential for the proper digestion and assimilation of fats and 
all fat-soluble nutrients such as vitamins A, D, E, K, lecithin, and 
essential fatty acids. The gall bladder is a hollow muscular organ which
 stores and concentrates bile and is attached to the undersurface of the
 liver. When a meal is eaten, especially if it contains some fats or 
oils, the gall bladder is stimulated to contract and should freely expel
 its contents into the small intestine to emulsify fatty nutrients for 
proper absorption, and to allow poisonous wastes which the liver has 
removed from the body to be eliminated through the intestines.</p>
<b><font size="6"><p align="CENTER"></p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc434239884">Liver Congestion</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Many people living in our society today, 
even those in their teens, fail to have free, unobstructed flow of bile 
from the liver and gall bladder in response to food entering the small 
intestine. Eating refined or processed foods, eating fresh food which is
 mineral deficient because it is grown on depleted or chemically treated
 soil, lack of regular vigorous exercise, stress, multiple distractions 
during meals, and many other unnatural aspects of our lifestyle have 
combined to alter the chemistry of bile so that formation of solid 
particles from bile components is a commonplace occurrence among 
Americans. These solid particles remain in the gall bladder or the base 
of the liver for many years and become progressively harder, sometimes 
calcifying into "gallstones." Long before this occurs, however, 
metabolic problems are under way. When a significant number of solid 
bile particles accumulate, the free flow of the gallbladder is 
diminished, causing progressive stagnation and congestion of the liver. 
The body begins to suffer the effects of poor assimilation of 
fat-soluble nutrients, which may play a role in the development of 
eczema, psoriasis, dry skin, falling hair, tendonitis, night blindness, 
accumulation of calcium in tissues, and sometimes prostate enlargement 
in men. Hemorrhoids due to blockage of the portal vein draining the 
liver are often the result of this congestion.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The importance of cleansing the debris 
from the liver and gall bladder, thus keeping the bile free flowing, 
cannot be overemphasized. This can be effectively accomplished by doing 
the Liver-Gall Bladder Flush (a form of which at one time was widely 
used at the world famous Lahey Clinic in Boston, MA), which is necessary
 even if one has had their gall bladder removed. The four basic active 
principles in this procedure are:</p>
<ol type="A">

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Apple juice (high in malic acid) or 
ortho-phosphoric acid, which acts as a solvent in the bile to weaken 
adhesions between solid globules.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate), taken by 
mouth and enema, which allows magnesium to be absorbed into the 
bloodstream, relaxing smooth muscles. Large solid particles which 
otherwise might create spasms are able to pass through a relaxed bile 
duct.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Olive oil, unrefined, which stimulates the 
gall bladder and bile duct to contract powerfully, thus expelling solid 
particles kept in storage for years.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Coffee enemas, which consist of a coffee 
solution retained in the colon. They activate the liver to secrete its 
waste into the bile, enhancing bile flow and further relaxing the bile 
duct muscle. </li><p></p></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Liver-Gall Bladder Flush is one of the most 
important procedures for persons over 15 years of age. If one is above 
15 years of age and his or her physician gives approval, he or she 
should do this the first week of Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure 
Program, and should, with his or her physician’s approval, repeat it 
every 2 months. The steps in doing this are not difficult and are as 
follows:</p>
<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>For 5 days prior to the "Flush," consume as 
much apple juice or cider as the appetite permits, in addition to 
regular meals. You may add a total of 60 drops of Formula HRT (Phosfood 
Liquid or Super Phos 30) to the apple juice or cider each day. 
Nutritional supplements should also be taken during this time. The first
 preference for juice would be freshly juiced organic apples, and 
secondly, apple juice or cider (unsweetened and preferably organic if 
possible) purchased either from the health food or grocery store. A 
person should be sure to read the labels carefully and obtain a juice 
that has no additives whatsoever. </li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If one is a severe hypoglycemic, is diabetic, or has 
difficulty tolerating the juice or cider, he or she may take 20 drops of
 HRT (Phosfood Liquid or Super Phos 30) with each meal (60 drops daily) 
in RO filtered water or distilled water or some type of juice other than
 apple. Due to the high acidity, it is wise that one brush his teeth or 
rinse out his mouth with Milk of Magnesia or baking soda solution after 
taking the ortho-phosphoric acid.)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>At noon on the sixth day, one should eat a normal lunch and take the Metabolic Formulas scheduled for that time.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Two hours after lunch, 1 or 2 tablespoons of 
Epsom salt (magnesium sulfate) dissolved in 1 to 3 ounces of warm 
mineral water, RO filtered water or distilled water should be taken. The
 taste may be objectionable to some. If so, the mixture can be followed 
by a little citrus juice if desired (freshly squeezed if possible). </li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Four hours after lunch, one should take a 
1-quart coffee enema with one-fourth (1/4) cup of Epsom salt dissolved 
in it. This should be retained for 15 minutes and expelled. The coffee 
should be made as strong as one can tolerate but no stronger than 6 
tablespoons of ground coffee per quart of water. </li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Five hours after lunch take 1 tablespoon of Epsom salt, dissolved as the previous dose (Step 3).</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Six or seven hours after lunch, one may fast 
if desired. However, it is preferable to have a fresh fruit salad, using
 as many fresh fruits in season as possible. Use heavy, unpasteurized 
whipping cream as a dressing on the salad, whipped with a little raw 
(unheated) honey if desired. One can eat as much as desired of the 
whipped-cream-covered salad. If fresh fruit is unavailable, frozen 
berries such as strawberries, blueberries, boysenberries, blackberries, 
raspberries, etc. can be used. These should also be covered with whipped
 cream and a large portion eaten. Take citrus fruit or juice after the 
cream and fruit meal, if desired. For hypoglycemics, the cream should 
balance the fruit. However, each hypoglycemic should adjust the amount 
of salad eaten to his individual tolerance.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>At bedtime, there can be 1 of 3 choices (<b>Note:</b>
 Olive oil stimulates the gall bladder and bile duct to contract 
powerfully, thus expelling solid particles kept in storage for years. 
All juice should be freshly squeezed if possible):</li><p></p></ol>

<ol type="A">

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Take one-half (1/2) cup of unrefined olive 
oil or 6 tablespoons of Formula F followed by a small amount of orange, 
grapefruit, or lemon juice if the oil taste is objectionable.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Take one-half (1/2) cup of unrefined olive 
oil or 6 tablespoons of Formula F blended with one-half (1/2) cup of 
orange, grapefruit, or diluted lemon juice.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Take 4 tablespoons of unrefined olive oil or 4
 tablespoons of Formula F followed by 1 tablespoon of citrus juice every
 30 minutes until 6 ounces of oil have been consumed. This choice is 
preferable for those who are unusually weak or who have had gall bladder
 problems in the past. It has been found helpful to rinse the mouth with
 an alcohol base drink like Sherry to cut out the residue of the oil 
taste. If an alcohol base drink is unobtainable, try a natural 
carbonated drink, or club soda. (<b>Do</b> <b>not swallow</b> the alcohol drink or the carbonated drink.) (<b>Note:</b>
 If one should vomit during the consumption of the oil and juice, the 
procedure should be continued until it is finished. It is not necessary 
to make up for the amount that was vomited. Nausea felt during this 
process usually indicates stimulation of the gall bladder and/or liver.)</li><p></p></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Immediately upon finishing the oil and juice 
(or while taking it), one should go to bed and lie on the right side 
with the right knee drawn up toward the chin for 30 minutes before going
 to sleep. This encourages the oil to drain from the stomach, helping 
contents of the gall bladder and/or liver to move into the small 
intestine.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>If one feels quite ill during the night, 
another strong coffee enema with one-fourth (1/4) cup of Epsom salt 
dissolved in it may be taken.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>If there is a strong feeling of nausea the

coffee enema with Epsom salt in it or, 1 hour before breakfast, take 1 
tablespoon of Epsom salt dissolved in 1 to 3 ounces of warm mineral 
water, RO filtered water or distilled water.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>If one continues to feel nauseous or very 
sore in the upper abdomen even after the enema, a light diet of sprouts,
 fruit (raw or steamed), yogurt or kefir, and freshly extracted 
vegetable juices (especially with beet greens in them) should be 
resumed. If one finds that the Metabolic Formulas cause discomfort 
immediately after the flush, they may be omitted for three days.</li><p></p></ol>

<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Note:</b> One should not be frightened by 
the above references to nausea, vomiting, soreness of the abdomen, etc. 
Chances are that the symptoms won’t be severe enough to cause vomiting 
or soreness of the abdomen, as this happens only very rarely. Many 
people complete this procedure with minimal discomfort, and nearly 
everyone feels much better after completing it. Flushing the liver and 
gall bladder in the manner described (if the gall bladder is present) 
stimulates and cleans these organs as no other process does.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Oftentimes, persons suffering for years from 
gallstones, lack of appetite, billiousness, backaches, nausea, and a 
host of other complaints will find gallstone-type objects in the stool 
the day following the flush. These objects are light to dark green in 
color, very irregular in shape, gelatinous in texture, and of sizes 
varying from "grape seed" size to "cherry" size. If there seems to be a 
large number of these objects in the stool, the flush should be repeated
 in 2 weeks.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">After The Liver-Gall Bladder Flush a fast 
may be started. The fast should last one or two days. We are now giving 
the body a rest and an opportunity to cleanse itself of much waste on 
the individual cell level. Each day of the fast one quart of fresh 
carrot juice and one pint of celery juice should be taken, along with 
all the RO filtered or distilled water desired. It is best to dilute the
 fresh juice with equal parts RO filtered or distilled water.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is important to remember that unless sufficient 
fluids are taken the poisons become concentrated and are not eliminated 
in the natural way.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc434239888">Cleansing The Small Intestine</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">If there were only one kind of pill that 
would help everybody, the cancer patient or otherwise, it would be 
"Okra-Pepsin-E3" made by Standard Process, Inc. It would probably do the
 nation’s health more good than any other one pill. It digests the mucus
 that coats the walls of many people’s small intestine. Certain foods, 
such as pasteurized milk and many cooked foods, cause the mucus buildup 
on the wall of the small intestine (raw foods do not cause this mucus 
buildup). The mucus coats the villi on the wall of the small intestine. 
The villi are like tiny fingers that stick out from the intestinal wall 
to absorb nutrients from the digested food, which is primarily liquid. 
The mucus on the villi blocks the absorption of nutrients from the food.
 Sometimes the mucus gets so thick and tough it is almost like a plastic
 film. Almost no nutrition can get through to the body. A person with a 
severe mucus buildup could take $1,000.00 worth of supplements a month 
along with a good diet and still get almost no nutritional value from 
them. He or she would be starving and therefore would want to eat more 
food including protein. That would lead to more of the pancreatic 
enzymes being used to digest the protein even though it could not be 
properly absorbed. When all the pancreatic enzymes are used up, there 
are none left in the blood to destroy cancer cells.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The okra is a very sticky, gooey, vegetable material.
 It tends to stick the pepsin enzyme to the mucus on the intestinal wall
 long enough to digest some of the mucus. The E-3 is a powerful tissue 
repair factor. It was originally developed for the patient with stomach 
ulcers or colitis. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If the Okra-Pepsin-E3 capsules are taken for a few 
days to several weeks, one after each meal (reduce the amount of 
capsules if diarrhea occurs), the mucus will gradually be digested. The 
blood can then receive more nutrients from the food, even if it is from a
 poor diet. Then, once a year, take the Okra-Pepsin-E3 capsules again 
for a few days or a week to keep the mucus from building back up.	</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The mucus blockage varies with different people. 
Sometimes it blocks minerals and larger molecules only, while in other 
people it partially blocks all nutrients. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">While taking the Okra-Pepsin-E3 capsules people who 
have heavily mucus-coated intestines might find mucus coming out with 
their stool, convoluted like the intestines. Dr. Kelley has had people 
who have been taking the capsules call him to say that they think they 
have just passed their intestines and what should they do? (He assures 
them it wasn’t their intestines; it was ropes — or tubes — of mucus!)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One 37-year-old patient called Dr. Kelley to report 
that the Okra-Pepsin-E3 capsules worked a miracle by relieving 
reoccurring pain that she had suffered with for years. (The pain would 
come and go apparently without cause and felt like bricks were pressing 
against her internal organs and lower back and at the same time her 
right side and leg would feel numb.) On the morning of the eighth day, 
after taking one Okra-Pepsin-E3 capsule with each meal for a week, she 
spent 45 minutes sweating, straining and pushing to have a bowel 
movement, and when it finally came out she could hardly believe what she
 saw — long, intertwined black ropes (or collapsed tubes) of mucus 
filled the toilet! She feels lighter now and hasn’t had the pain since 
that day. (After this bowel movement and the disappearance of her pain 
she realized that there must have been a connection to eating a large 
meal and the pain — food passing through the intestine would push the 
mucus-coated intestine onto nerves, which caused the pain and numbness.)
    </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Okra-Pepsin-E3 is indicated for both underweight 
and overweight people. In both cases nutrients are not being absorbed. 
Even if they are taking enzymes to digest the food they eat, they absorb
 only the smaller carbohydrate molecules while the larger protein 
molecules are blocked. In underweight people the carbohydrates are used 
efficiently (burned for energy, not turned into fat), but the person 
becomes thin as they lose muscle mass from lack of protein absorption. 
In overweight people the carbohydrates are not used efficiently (they 
are turned into fat), and this causes the person to become overweight as
 they also lose muscle mass.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Metamucil™ (Pysllium husks), one or two tablespoons 
daily, mixed with water or juice, may be taken to sweep the mucus out of
 the colon once it is broken down by the pepsin in the Okra-Pepsin-E3 
capsules.</p>

<p><a name="_Toc430362491"></a><a name="_Toc434239890">The Coffee Enema</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">A high, retention enema, using coffee, 
should be taken to aid in the elimination of toxic waste material from 
the body. The coffee enema should be taken daily for as long as one is 
on Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure Program. After 35 years, Dr. Kelley 
still takes his daily enema.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The coffee enema is very stimulating to the liver and is the greatest aid in elimination of the liver’s toxic wastes. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The coffee enema, besides stimulating liver 
detoxification, also has beneficial effects in cleaning the colon. 
Coffee is an excellent solvent for encrusted waste accumulated along the
 walls of the colon. The caffeine also directly stimulates the 
peristaltic muscle to contract more powerfully and loosen such deposits,
 which are occasionally visible as hard, black material and "ropes" of 
mucus. Gradually, as the protein metabolism of the body improves, the 
muscle tone of the bowel becomes normal and thorough evacuation is 
possible without the aid of the enema.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Essentially, the coffee enemas help the liver perform
 a task for which it was not designed — that of elimination in 1 or 2 
years the accumulated wastes from many years of living in ignorance of 
the laws of nature.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At first, most people dislike enemas and have 
psychological barriers against them. Ignorance of the purpose and 
function of the enema, as well as misunderstanding of the proper 
procedure for taking it bring about this aversion. I have observed, 
however, that the persons most opposed to enemas soon reverse their 
prejudices and become the most avid supporters of them! In many cases, 
the enema relieves distress and gives a sense of well being and 
cleanliness never before experienced. The proper removal of toxins and 
debris from the colon is absolutely essential in all conditions of 
disease and ill health.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is most desirable to take the coffee enema early 
in the morning and it may be repeated again in early afternoon and/or 
evening, depending upon the toxic condition of the body. Enemas using 
coffee in the afternoon or evening may interfere with sound sleep. If 
enemas are needed at these times, many patients prefer to use only warm 
pure water omitting the coffee. But it is better to take coffee at these
 times also, and a weaker solution to permit sleep would be better than 
not using coffee at all.</p>

</font></b><font size="5"></font><ol><font size="5"><b>

</b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Just before bedtime each day, make a pot of coffee (1 quart). Unplug coffeepot and allow to cool to room temperature.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>It is best to arise early enough each morning to allow time to take the enema in a relaxed, unhurried state.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The coffee must be regular, non-instant, 
non-decaffeinated coffee. It must be prepared in enamelware, Corning 
Ware™, glass or stainless steel, or by the tricolator filter method. 
Aluminum or Teflon should not be used at any time! We have found the 
coffee that is unboiled or prepared via the "drip method" is preferable.
 Use 3 to 4 tablespoons of ground coffee to 1 quart of Filtered Reverse 
Osmosis (RO) or distilled water. Any water that enters into the body 
should be RO filtered or distilled water.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Avoidance of city water supplies (always chlorinated,
 which has been strongly linked to hardening of the arteries, and often 
fluoridated, which has been strongly linked to cancer and thyroid 
disease) is most essential to removing stress from the kidneys. Pure RO 
filtered water or distilled water should be used for cooking and 
drinking — and even for preparing enemas, since a significant portion of
 the enema water may be absorbed and filtered through the kidneys. Even 
if one has a well, it should not be assumed safe. Often toxic amounts of
 copper, cadmium, and lead are picked up from the plumbing even if the 
well is pure. It is best to purchase a small distilling unit and distill
 from one’s tap. If one distills water from a city supply, one must 
remember that certain hydrocarbon contaminants have a lower boiling 
point than that of water. The distiller should have a valve to permit 
their escape as they gasify. If not, they will concentrate in the 
distilled water and will need to be removed by filtering through 
activated charcoal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One may purchase a Reverse Osmosis Filter Unit from:</p>
<p align="CENTER">Sparkling Water Company — 800-460-5728 or<br>

<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Note:</b> Filters breed deadly bacteria. If
 your water supply is dirty a filter will get dirty in less than 30 days
 — A filter should be changed every 30 days even if your water supply is
 clean. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>If a coffee enema makes a person jittery, 
shaky, nervous, nauseated, or light-headed, the coffee solution is too 
strong. The amount of coffee can be adjusted from 1 teaspoon to 4 
tablespoons per quart of water as tolerance level permits.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The high, retention coffee enema should 
consist of 1 quart of coffee, held for 15 minutes. Some people, children
 especially, can take and retain only a pint (2 cups) of enema solution 
at a time. If this is the case, one must take 2 enemas each time, one 
right after the other, and hold each for 15 minutes as directed.</li><p></p>

</font></b><font size="5"></font><ol type="A"><font size="5"><b>

</b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Before the enema do some form of 
mild exercise if possible, such as walking briskly. If one is extremely 
debilitated and weak, this step will of course need to be omitted until 
strength returns.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Attempt a normal bowel movement. The enema is
 much more effective if the colon has been evacuated. One should not 
become disturbed, however, if there are no regular bowel movements, or 
very few, during Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure Program. In many 
cases, not enough bulk collects to instigate a normal bowel movement. 
When no normal bowel movements are forthcoming, the enema cleans the 
colon adequately.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Bulk formers such as Metamucil™ (or other 
brands of Psylliuum Husks obtainable at drug or health food stores) 
taken as directed, or 2 tablespoons of miller’s bran with each meal 
(obtainable at the health food store) are quite helpful in forming 
stools and thereby creating more normal bowel movements for those who 
take daily enemas. </li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>After the normal bowel movement, if one is 
forthcoming, or before taking the coffee retention enema, most people 
find that taking an enema with 1 quart of warm RO filtered water or 
distilled water is very helpful (do not retain this enema). This 
procedure begins the cleansing of the colon, removing large particles of
 residue and most of the gas. When it is completed, the coffee retention
 enema may be taken. The warm water enema is optional and does not need 
to be taken if the coffee enema can be retained for the desired period.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Place 1 quart of coffee in your enema bag or 
bucket. You may use a Fleet enema bag, which is a disposable large 
volume plastic bag, an over-the-counter item from the local pharmacy or 
hospital supply outlet. This enema bag lasts about 2 years.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The enema tip on the end of the hose is not 
adequate to give a "high enema." Place a colon tube (DAVOL) size 24 
French or 26 French or 28 French on the opposite end of the plastic tube
 from the enema bag. This colon tube is a soft flexible rubber-like tube
 around 30 inches in length. It follows the curves and flexure of the 
colon. The colon tube is usually inserted about 12 to 20 inches into the
 rectum. (Editor’s Note: It is difficult today to find a colon tube. 
However, a plastic rectal catheter or tube about 18 inches long may be 
ordered from your pharmacy as an over-the-counter item.) </li><p></p>
<li>Next, allow the coffee to flow to the end of the colon tube, thus eliminating any air in the tube.</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The colon tube should be lubricated with 
natural creamery butter, Vitamin E cream or other lubricant that doesn’t
 contain additives or chemicals.</li><p></p>
<li>Insert the tube 12 to 20 inches into the rectum, if possible. This 
should be done slowly, in a rotating motion that helps to keep the tube 
from "kinking up" inside the colon.</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The enema bag should not be over 36 inches 
higher than the rectum. If it is placed too high, the coffee runs into 
the colon too fast and under too much pressure, causing discomfort.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>There are several positions that can be used 
while inserting the colon tube. Squatting is one. There is also the 
knee-chest method, with chest and knees on the floor and buttocks in the
 highest position possible. Most people, however, find it easiest to lie
 on the left side until the solution is out of the bag or bucket. The 
enema should never be taken while sitting on the toilet or standing.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Some people’s colons have kinks or turns in 
them that may prevent the tube from being inserted even 18 inches. 
Often, if a little bit of the solution is allowed to flow into the colon
 as the tube is being inserted, one may comfortably get past these 
kinks.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>If a kink bends the tube too much and stops 
the flow of liquid, then the tube can be inserted only as far as it will
 go, still allowing the liquid to flow freely.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Sometimes, if one hits a kink that stops the 
flow of the liquid completely, the tube can be pulled out slowly just to
 the point where the solution is felt flowing again. Frequently, the 
tube can be pushed back in, past the turn that previously stopped the 
liquid.</li><p></p>
<li>Because of the shapes and formations of some people’s colons or of 
course if a child is being given the enema, it will be possible to 
insert the tube only a few inches. Occasionally, this is a permanent 
situation. Often, however, as the colon is cleaned and healed, the tube 
can eventually be inserted further.</li>
<li>The tube should <i>never</i> be forced when discomfort occurs.</li>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>After the flow of the solution is completed, 
one may remove the colon tube, although it isn’t necessary to do so. 
Regardless of the position used up to this point, one should now lie on 
the left side for at least 5 minutes, then on the back for another 5 
minutes, then on the right side for at least 5 minutes.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Those who have excessive gas may leave the 
tube in the colon with the hose clamp open. This allows gas to escape 
through the enema container. Frequently, the coffee will go in and out 
of the enema bag or bucket until the gas is relieved.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>After the enema is retained for 15 minutes or longer, it may be expelled.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>One is now ready for the rest of his daily routine clean and refreshed!</li><p></p></ol>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Occasionally, the intestinal tract will 
become obstructed. Usually under these circumstances, no food or feces 
will come through. After a few days, one becomes extremely nauseated and
 starts vomiting. He or she will be very sick and will normally run a 
high temperature. This should be watched quite carefully, for in such 
cases immediate emergency treatment is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One should never allow themselves to become extremely
 toxic. But, in order to distinguish between a healing toxic reaction 
and an intestinal obstruction, as soon as nausea or vomiting develops 
and no food is passing through, all supplements and food should be 
stopped for 5 days. Water and juice may be taken during this time.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If there is no vomiting, food is passing through, and
 the temperature remains below 100 degrees, the diet and normal routine 
may be resumed, as one may assume there is no obstruction.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A point to remember is that one shouldn’t fail to cycle off the supplements routinely before reaching such a state of toxicity!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If, during the 5 days off the supplements with no

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The kidneys are vital organs of 
detoxification. They filter approximately 4,000 quarts of blood daily. 
The metabolic wastes, largely urea, are eliminated and the acid/alkaline
 balance maintained. Many drugs are eliminated through the kidneys, 
especially the common pain-killing drugs that can be extremely damaging 
to these organs. Such drugs include aspirin, phenacetin and 
acetominophen. People often don’t experience any symptoms from loss of 
kidney function until 90% of the function is gone, and then the damage 
is irreversible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The kidneys should be flushed each day with liberal 
quantities of fluid, either RO filtered water, distilled water or fresh 
fruit and vegetable juices (preferably organic). Parsley tea is 
excellent for strengthening the kidneys. Those with kidney problems 
should avoid ordinary commercial teas and coffee as a beverage. Herbal 
teas are acceptable.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For those who tend to retain fluid, watermelon is an 
excellent diuretic. If the melon is organically grown, the rind should 
be juiced and sipped first thing in the morning and then the red fleshy 
part of the fruit may be eaten. Two mornings a week, one may take the 
juice of a whole lemon in warm RO filtered water or distilled water as a
 diuretic (citrus should not be used more than 2 days a week, as it 
tends to upset the calcium-phosphorus metabolism if used more 
frequently). Shavegrass or horsetail tea is a good diuretic and also 
good for the skin and hair. An excellent diuretic salad may be made by 
combining cabbage and onions — finely sliced — with crushed raw garlic, 
parsley, and herbs like sage, cumin, and juniper berries, if available. 
Cover this mixture with very hot RO filtered water or distilled water 
and place a lid over it for 10 minutes. Drain the mixture (the liquid is
 good to save for soup bases, grains, etc.) and squeeze a lemon over it.
 It can be eaten as is or refrigerated first. It can also be mixed with 
other salads.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In extreme fluid retention, one’s physician may 
prescribe a diuretic drug, which is permissible, and the doctor will 
normally increase the intake of potassium to compensate for its loss due
 to the drug.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In kidney disease the protein intake should be limited and extra vitamins and minerals taken. </p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Life is dependent upon the adequate 
exchanges of gases in the lungs. The most significant are the removal of
 carbonic acid and the flow of oxygen into the blood. The lungs give off
 many other gaseous wastes. Sometimes before, but more frequently after 
the start of Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure Program the patient or 
those close to him or her may notice a foul odor on the breath. No 
amount of toothpaste or mouthwash will remove it for long, since it 
comes from the bloodstream. One can be assured, however, that this is 
only a phase and that the poisons are leaving the body.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If there is excessive accumulation of mucus in the 
nostrils and/or bronchial system, this inhibits the detoxification 
functions of the lungs. Mucus-forming food should be avoided if mucus is
 a problem. These are principally dairy products, with the exception of 
butter and cream, and baked flour products. Anti-mucus foods such as raw
 onions and garlic, cayenne pepper, freshly ground black pepper, fresh 
ginger, and horseradish should be eaten liberally. </p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Most people overlook the skin as an organ 
of detoxification. But it is sometimes called "the third kidney," since 
many of its functions in fluid and electrolyte balance are similar to 
those of the kidneys. When great amounts of poisons flood the body, all 
systems are overloaded and this function of the skin is sorely needed. 
As the skin is utilized, all sorts of eruptions, odors, colors, and 
blemishes may appear. These conditions will disappear as the body 
becomes purified. One can quickly assess the relative efficiency of 
elimination through the skin by looking at his iris (the colored portion
 of the eye). The skin is represented by the outermost part of the iris.
 If it is very dark and dense, the condition is called a "scurf rim" in 
iridology, and it means that the skin is relatively blocked as an organ 
of elimination. To open it up, skin brushing before a shower and 
vigorous use of a loofah sponge in the shower are recommended. A good 
quality vegetable-bristle, skin brush should be purchased from the 
health food store or pharmacy. One should brush up the front of the body
 and down the back, over all exposed skin surfaces, until a warm glow is
 felt. Then one should take a warm shower and rub briskly with a loofah 
sponge (available in most health food stores) to remove the layers of 
dead skin loosened by the brushing. (We have found it best to take a hot
 shower each morning.) </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Castile or other pure soap should be used — but in a
 minimal amount, since heavy soaping will wash all the valuable skin 
oils off and can cause the skin to overproduce oil in order to 
compensate. The hair should be shampooed frequently with a non-chemical 
soap or shampoo, which can be found in health food stores.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	At the end of the shower, one should turn the water 
to cool, then to warm. As one becomes accustomed to the temperature 
change, he or she may go from hot to cold and back several times. This 
exercises the tiny muscles in the skin, which control dilation and 
contraction of the pores. As they become stronger, they can respond 
better to the physiological demands of the body.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	After the shower, one can sit in a tub of water with
 a cup of apple cider vinegar added, to restore and strengthen the acid 
mantle of the skin. Afterward, the body should be dried and rubbed 
briskly with a towel until a warm glow is felt.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Epsom salt baths may also be used to help draw 
toxins out of the skin. These baths are especially beneficial if one is 
going through a "healing crisis" and is especially toxic and feeling 
bad. Such a bath works best after the skin brushing and use of a loofah 
sponge. A tub is filled with warm to hot water and 4 or more cups of 
Epsom salt are dissolved in it. This bath is quite relaxing and good for
 tense, sore muscles, and may be taken as often as needed. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Every fourth night the cancer patient should be 
rubbed from head to toe with a mixture of olive oil and castor oil in 
equal parts. Then a hot soaking bath should be taken for 15 minutes to 
allow the oil to penetrate. This is followed by going to bed under heavy
 covers for about one hour to sweat the poisons out. Then a cleansing 
shower is taken. This may be discontinued after three months.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Salt-water irrigation of the nostrils is 
very helpful with nasal mucus and sinus congestion alike. If one cannot 
breathe through the nose, he or she is bypassing a crucial filtering 
mechanism which warms and humidifies the air, and which removes large 
amounts of smoke and dust before this air reaches the back of one’s 
throat. Mouth breathing places incalculable stress on the lungs, nearly 
equivalent to that of cigarette smoking if one lives in urban pollution.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To irrigate the nostrils, dissolve 1 teaspoon of sea 
salt in 16 ounces of warm water in a bowl of appropriate size. While 
bending forward, block one nostril and place the other below the water 
surface in the bowl. The water should be gently pulled up the nostril 
until one can taste the salty mixture trickling to the back of the 
throat; then it should be blown out. This should be repeated with the 
other nostril and alternated several times.	</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Breathing exercises should follow the 
cleansing of the nostrils. If done on a regular basis, these yield 
tremendous benefits. They increase the body’s supply of oxygen (which is
 the basic currency for repair and for burning up toxins), step up the 
removal of waste products and stagnant air from portions of the lungs 
otherwise unused, and exercise the diaphragm — which serves as a pump 
for the flow of oxygen and nerve energy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Deep breathing yields a multitude of benefits through maximum use of lung capacity.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Rapid breathing is an energizing exercise, which 
promotes flow of energy into the lungs and digestive organs. It should 
be done before meals, after being in a stuffy room, or whenever a lift 
is needed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Alternate-nostril breathing has a calming effect on 
the nervous system. It can be used effectively to overcome anxiety 
states and insomnia, and sometimes to relieve headaches. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Breath is the external manifestation of our life force. It <i>is</i> our very life. We can live for a while without food or drink, but not without breath.	</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">In almost every case of cancer, 
particularly those cases of long standing, the protein from the muscles 
has been used to maintain life. In other words protein metabolism has 
been so poor that the body had to take protein from the muscles and, to a
 very great degree, the muscles have been consumed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After the cancer is destroyed, the muscles begin to 
rebuild. This takes approximately three years. If the muscles are 
exercised strenuously during this time a hernia may develop. For this 
reason we have found it best to replace strenuous exercise with a brisk 
walk at least once a day for three years following therapy.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">About the year 424 BC Hippocrates, the 
father of modern medicine, made the statement, "Your food shall be your 
medicine and your medicine shall be your food." Try as we may, we have 
not been able to improve upon this basic truth. This is particularly 
true when it comes to the successful treatment of the cancer patient. At
 least 86% of all cancer conditions could be adequately treated and/or 
prevented by diet alone.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It never ceases to amaze me at the number of learned 
as well as ignorant persons who scoff when diet is mentioned. They all 
seem to believe that no matter what is placed into the body, by some 
magical process, it makes for perfect health. Yet these same people are 
very fastidious and concerned about what, how and how much food is fed 
to their pedigreed dogs and cats and their registered cattle and horses.
 It is ironic that they cannot see that their own health is equally 
dependent upon a proper balanced nutritional process.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc434239904">Kelley Almond Diet</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">From the first printing of this book in 
1967 we have called our diet the "Kelley Almond Diet" because the 
principal protein is almond and vegetable protein.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Raw almonds are a very good source of protein and may be used as directed: 10 almonds at breakfast and 10 almonds at lunch.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A mixture of raw almonds, cashews, pecans, filberts, 
Brazil nuts, walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, and sesame seeds 
is recommended to supplement protein during the first six months when 
meat proteins are severely restricted. These should be eaten any time up
 to 1:00 p.m. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Cashew nuts are desirable, especially if the patient is also suffering from hypoglycemia (low blood sugar).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Nuts, seeds, and grains should be stored in closed 
containers in a very cool location. Refrigeration is best if one has the
 space.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Some enzyme researchers do not recommend the use of 
raw seeds or nuts, claiming that the enzyme inhibitors in the seeds or 
nuts make proper digestion difficult. This is true in one sense — if raw
 nuts and seeds were swallowed whole without masticating them, a person 
couldn’t digest them properly. But if nuts and seeds are chewed well or 
soaked overnight (in RO filtered or distilled water) the activity of 
enzyme inhibitors is greatly reduced or nullified. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Should you have difficulty chewing whole raw almonds,
 you may substitute two tablespoons of pure raw almond or sesame seed 
butter.</p>
<b><font size="6"><p align="CENTER"></p>
<p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362507"></a><a name="_Toc430363807"></a><a name="_Toc434239905">Protein</a> (Phase One)</p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">We have maintained throughout this 
treatise that cancer is nothing more than a pancreatic enzyme 
deficiency. The greatest cause of this deficiency is the amount of 
cooked protein (mutated amino acids) fed into the body. The pancreas 
simply cannot manufacture enough enzymes to digest the large volumes of 
pasteurized milk and cheese and cooked meat we eat and have any enzymes 
left over to digest the foreign protein we know as cancer. If people 
would not eat protein after 1:00 p.m., 86% of cancer in the United 
States could be eliminated.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">However, a cancer patient should never give up all 
protein, as they might be tempted to do when they first learn that too 
much protein in the diet prevents the pancreas from ridding the body of 
cancer. The pancreatic enzymes themselves consist of protein (amino 
acids), and unless the body is fed adequate protein, the pancreatic 
enzyme production will stop and the cancer tissue will make a very rapid
 growth. The total withdrawal from protein has been the fallacy of many 
cancer diets, such as the "Grape Cure." This is also the reason these 
diets have worked so well for the first few months — no protein — thus 
freeing the pancreatic enzymes to digest the cancer. Yet, over prolonged
 periods of total abstinence from protein, the pancreas fails. Proper 
balance and regulated intake is the answer.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362510"></a><a name="_Toc430363810"></a><a name="_Toc434239906">Protein Timing</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">	It is not only imperative that the 
correct kind and quantity of protein be eaten, but of equal importance, 
it must be taken at a specific time. We have found that regular proteins
 should be taken at breakfast and lunch only. When this is strictly 
observed the pancreatic enzymes, used in digestion of protein, are used 
only about 6 hours. This leaves 18 hours for production of pancreatic 
enzymes to digest cancer tissue. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	If the average cancer patient is carefully observed,
 it will be noted that they start the day with protein — a glass of 
milk, ham and/or bacon and eggs, or milk with cereal. By mid-morning 
they are ravenous and have a candy bar, peanuts, doughnuts or sweet 
rolls with a soft drink or coffee. For lunch they normally have a roast 
beef sandwich, or chicken fried in "trans-fatty acid" vegetable oil, or a
 hamburger. By mid-afternoon they are again hungry and have been 
attacked by low blood sugar, so they perk themselves up with coffee or a
 soft drink. Dinner consists of a charbroiled steak, or a piece of roast
 beef or other cooked meat with white flour gravy and cooked-to-death 
vegetables. For desert there is ice cream or pie a la mode with another 
glass of milk. It is impossible for the pancreas to produce enough 
enzymes under these conditions.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362513"></a><a name="_Toc430363813"></a><a name="_Toc434239907">Eggs</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Eggs are an unusually good source of 
protein — well balanced and the standard by which all protein is 
evaluated. They have all the essential amino acids in proper 
proportions. The cancer patient may have two eggs (preferably raw) each 
day at anytime.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Proper preparation of eggs is of vital importance. 
The eggs must be heated in the shell. We bring our eggs to a temperature
 of 140º F. to 160º F. (which is the normal temperature of hot tap 
water), for five minutes before cracking them. This destroys an enzyme 
just inside the membrane under the shell that prevents the biotin in the
 egg from functioning normally. When biotin functions properly, it 
greatly reduces the cholesterol risks of eating eggs. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After preheating before cracking them, the eggs may 
then be eaten, as you prefer them. Raw and soft-boiled eggs are the most
 preferable, though it isn’t absolutely necessary to eat them in these 
forms. In keeping with the use of as much raw food as possible, a good 
procedure is to eat the eggs raw in a blended drink of some kind, 
flavored to suit one’s taste. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There was a group of research doctors and dentists 
who, for at least a dozen years, had eaten two eggs daily (properly 
prepared as above), as part of a well-balanced nutritional program. 
Tests conducted on these people showed no increase in cholesterol. In 
fact, there was a significant decrease in the blood serum cholesterol 
level of each individual.	 </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Misconceived beliefs of the orthodox medical world 
about eating cholesterol-containing foods have caused countless people 
to be unduly alarmed about cholesterol levels and the associated 
possibility of heart attacks. These misconceptions, carried on from the 
early 1950’s, have been proven false.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc434239908">Liver</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Liver is a wonderful energy food and 
cannot be surpassed as a blood builder. It is especially crucial for 
leukemia and lymphoma patients, as their blood is unusually weak. 
However, all cancer patients can benefit from the intake of raw liver 
before noon each day. In the mid 1960s, when Dr. Kelley was told he was 
in the final stages of pancreatic and liver cancer, he found that raw 
liver blended into carrot juice gave him strength when everything else 
he ate made him feel ill.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Raw organic, antibiotic-free and hormone-free liver 
contains a multitude of live enzymes, amino acids and other intrinsic 
factors that science has not yet identified, which are destroyed when 
the liver is cooked. (References to "intrinsic" or "unidentified" food 
factors are fairly common in nutritional literature. They result from 
clinical reactions, which cannot be linked to known nutrients. Raw liver
 for cancer patients is an excellent example of powerful therapeutic, 
but unexplained, effects.) There are no supplements or drugs that can 
take the place of raw liver; none are in any way comparable in their 
effects. Eating raw liver ensures thorough digestion and the replacement
 of expended nutrients, promoting excellent health.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Raw liver is best if it is organic, antibiotic-free, 
hormone-free and not irradiated. However, if this type of raw liver is 
unavailable, fresh muscle meat, steaks and ground, are acceptable even 
if you buy them at regular markets. Organically grown and not irradiated
 is always more nutritious and preferable. But if organic isn’t 
available, commercial is healthier than none. At least 3 and no more 
than 6 heaping tablespoons of raw liver should be taken daily.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Chewing the liver is best for proper digestion. 
However, if masticating it is too objectionable, it will digest well 
even swallowed whole, if it is sliced into small enough cubes, and if 
adequate hydrochloric acid and enzymes are taken.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are two methods which people find suitable for preparing liver:</p>
<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The liver can be sliced about ¼ inch thick, 
placed on a cookie sheet, and frozen. After it is frozen, it can be cut 
into ¼ inch cubes. One can then use plastic sandwich bags, putting 3 to 6
 tablespoons of frozen cubed liver in each bag and storing them in the 
freezer for daily eating. This frozen liver may be chewed or swallowed 
whole, followed by a sip of juice if desired. Some prefer to allow the 
liver to thaw and then to place a spoonful at a time in the mouth and 
chew it or swallow it whole with a sip of juice.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Liver may be placed in the blender with 
carrot, pineapple, or tomato juice (and seasoning of one’s preference if
 desired), blended, strained to remove the fiber if preferred, and used 
as a morning "pep-up" drink. </li><p></p></ol>

<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc434239909">Meat (Cooked and Commercially Produced)</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The cancer patient will want to give up 
cooked and commercially produced meat such as beef, pork, lamb and fowl 
immediately (except for raw liver — see above). Cooked meat is harmful 
for the cancer patient, as the very same enzymes used in its digestion 
are needed for fighting and digesting the cancer. All natural, self-made
 enzymes your body can produce should be used to fight the cancer. 
Commercial meat should be avoided for another reason; it has a high 
female sex hormone content. For commercial reasons most animals, 
especially beef and fowl produced in the United States have been fed 
large quantities of hormones. Since an overabundance of female sex 
hormones initiate cancer, meat of this type should be excluded from the 
cancer patient’s diet. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After being on Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure Diet 
for 9 to 12 months, when the tumors are under control, one may gradually
 resume consumption of meat as long as one’s metabolic type requires it 
(see Chapter VIII, Metabolic Typing — Discovering Your Personal 
Nutritional Needs) and adequate enzymes and hydrochloric acid are taken 
to digest it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If and when one does go back to eating meat, it will 
be extremely wise to make every effort to find a source that can provide
 meat, which has been produced without chemical feed, hormones, 
antibiotics, and pesticide residues. </p>

Medicine’s Cancer Cure Diet the cancer patient must increase the 
quantity of protein in his diet. At this time not less than sixty grams 
of protein daily should be included in the diet. You should, of course, 
continue all the above approved protein, but now you may include (or 
increase) such proteins as those found in deep sea fish, all forms of 
seeds, nuts (except peanuts), nut butters, whole grains, whole grain 
breads, and homemade, raw (unpasteurized) goats’ milk yogurt and/or 
buttermilk.</p>

cancer patients, and may be eaten after 1:00 p.m. We freely use brown 
sesame, sunflower and pumpkinseeds. Many people enjoy sprouted seeds, 
such as alfalfa and mung beans, buckwheat, wheat and soybeans.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	The most "living foods" are sprouted seeds. When 
seeds are soaked in water, their protective enzyme inhibitors are 
removed and the enzymes, which have been "asleep," become active, and in
 three days the nutritional values of the seeds are increased 
tremendously. The seeds also become much easier to digest.</p>

of food for the cancer patient, and may be used two or three times a 
week at anytime of the day. The best way we’ve found to prepare them is 
to cook them at a temperature of 200º F. We place two cups of dried 
beans (washed) in a bean pot to which we add five cups of RO filtered or
 distilled water, five garlic cloves, two tablespoons of olive oil, 1 
teaspoon of sea salt or kelp, and 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. We 
place the pot, (covered), in an oven overnight at 200º F.</p>

fresh raw vegetable juice in volume may be taken as desired. One should 
consider alfalfa, beet, cabbage, cucumber, dandelion, endive, lettuce, 
parsley, potato, spinach, and turnip juice. Vegetable juices are the 
builders of the body. Juice is better than the whole vegetable because 
so much energy is used to digest the whole vegetable. Juice has a proper
 balance of vitamins and minerals in a concentrated solution. We 
recommend that the juice be made fresh and used immediately.</p>

Essential Fatty Acids must be provided in the diet, as the human body 
cannot make them.)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Johanna Budwig, a German researcher, did the lion’s 
share of the early work on flax oil and its therapeutic uses in the 
early 1950s. Blood samples from healthy and sick people were 
systematically analyzed, and the findings tabulated. According to her, 
blood samples from people with cancer, diabetes, and some kinds of liver
 disease consistently lacked Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs). She claims 
that blood from people with other diseases did not show this severe

cancer is a deficiency disease brought on by lack of EFAs, she reasoned,
 a diet high in EFAs should alleviate at least some of the cancer 
patients’ problems.  </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Unrefined Flaxseed oil, in practice, inhibits tumor 
growth and is useful in the natural treatment of cancer. EFAs, from

example, if you plant a raw potato it will grow. If you boil a potato 
and plant it, it will not grow it will rot. Many enzymes are destroyed 
at 107º F. and almost all are destroyed at 140º F.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When a person eats anything processed he or she is 
not only eating "dead food" (those in which the enzymes have been 
destroyed), but he or she is adding a second very destructive force to 
his body, the destructive force of food preservatives. This may not be 
too significant for a normal healthy person, but for the cancer patient 
it may mean life or death. The liver must detoxify, destroy, or 
metabolize all foreign substances from the body. When one eats foods 
with preservatives, it adds an extra burden upon the liver, which the 
cancer patient cannot accept.</p>

pasteurized cows’ milk forever, except in the form of raw 
(unpasteurized), homemade yogurt, and for a while must avoid raw milk 
too, except raw (unpasteurized) goats’ milk. Cows’ milk, like meat, has 
too high a protein content and pasteurization compounds the problem as 
it alters or mutates the protein. Pasteurized cows’ milk requires too 
many pancreatic enzymes for digestion. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Also, an animal cannot produce milk unless the female
 sex hormones are present in extra large quantities; this causes too 
many hormones in milk for the person who has cancer. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">But if raw goats’ milk is available, it is advisable 
to take 4 to 8 ounces of raw (unpasteurized), homemade goats’ milk 
(goats’ milk is similar to humans’ milk) yogurt each morning for 
breakfast. This will supply the intestines with adequate helpful 
bacteria. This is acceptable because the yogurt bacteria predigest the 
milk protein when added to it.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After following this diet for 9 to 12 months and if 
raw goats’ or cows’ milk is available. 9 to 12 ounces per day may be

up peanuts. First, the peanut is not a nut, but a legume. Second, the 
peanut also has too much protein for the cancer patient. Third, it has

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">All concentrated foods are extremely hard 
on the liver and should be given up. White flour and all products 
containing white flour should be avoided. These are not only 
concentrated carbohydrates, but almost always have preservatives added.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Use fresh whole wheat bread, made from wheat grown 
free of all pesticides (another liver destroying chemical). The 
essential vitamins are oxidized within three days at room temperature; 
hence the need for grinding only as used. Freshly ground flour or 
freshly made whole wheat bread may be safely stored deep in a deep 
freeze for about a week. It is best, however, to use it within three 
days.</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362527">White Sugar</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The cancer patient will also want to give 
up all white sugar and white sugar products. The concentrated 
carbohydrates are hard on the liver, but more important in relation to 
cancer, they are very hard on the pancreas. The pancreas, as noted 
earlier, is the first organ to be protected at all costs. White sugar 
has been processed (refined) and all the vital minerals are taken out. 
Cancer patients are always deficient in minerals.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For those who have a sweet tooth, these organic foods
 may be eaten as desired: dates, date sugar, figs and raisins obtained 
from a health food store. These are free of toxic pesticides and are not
 harmful to the pancreas or the liver. A cancer patient may also eat 
pure maple syrup or unheated honey, in that order. The first is 
preferable because it has a higher mineral content.</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362528">Soy Products</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Soy products, except Lecithin, should be 
used very sparingly for two reasons: First, the protein content is too 
high for the cancer patient; Second, soy products tend to upset the 
delicate acid/alkaline balance of the body. Eating soy products may be 
resumed when Dr. Kelley’s Pancreas Self-Examination Procedure is 
negative (see page 15).</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362529">Other Improper Foods</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Lemon juice should replace vinegar 
altogether. Vinegar is too harsh on the delicate mucus membrane of the 
alimentary canal. Also, the ingestion of large quantities of vinegar 
causes the digestive tract to become too acid and thus decreases the 
efficiency of the pancreatic enzymes and the digestive processes. For at
 least the first eight months on Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure 
Program, lemon juice should be used in preference to vinegar on salads. 
Unrefined, organic flaxseed oil may be used as salad dressing (see page 
22, Formula F).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	For the period of intensive detoxification and 
treatment, tea, coffee, soft drinks, chocolate, liquor, tobacco, pork,

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">	While the body is being properly detoxified and nourished, the nerve supply to the pancreas and liver should be considered.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	A specific organ works only when told to by a nerve,
 chemical, or pressure stimulation. Upon taking careful histories, we 
found a number of cancer patients who had had blows to the head or 
spine. We feel that such experiences change the nerve impulses to the 
various organs. If pressure on a nerve to the pancreas causes it to 
cease sending impulses to the pancreas, the pancreas will turn off and 
wait until the nerve tells it to work again. If the nerve is destroyed, 
or for some reason never sends a message, the pancreatic function will 
be greatly impaired.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Probably the best way to reactivate the nerve 
enervation is through some form of manipulative therapy such as 
osteopathic manipulation, chiropractic adjustments, or physiotherapy. We
 have found it advisable to have a weekly manipulative treatment for at 
least the first nine months of cancer treatment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Neurological stimulation can sometimes be increased 
or simulated by hormone therapy, but this technique must be performed 
under the direction of a very highly skilled clinician.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	There is a group of dentists who use a method called
 Mandibular Equilibration Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) equilibration) 
to re-shape the skull, take stresses from the brain, and in this way 
effect very profound neurological changes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	The following are brief descriptions of a few highly successful body-aligning systems. </p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362534"></a><a name="_Toc430363830"></a><a name="_Toc434239928">Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Equilibration</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">	Temporomandibular Joint is such a 
mouthful that dentists like to use just the initials. It is the name of 
the joint just in front of the ear where the lower jaw hinges. There is 
one on the right side, and one on the left. When one or both of them are
 forced out of place it may lead to such distressing or painful 
conditions as earache, headache, head noises, clicking sounds, 
dizziness, nervousness and even mental troubles.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	For such ailments as these, doctors may prescribe 
hot and cold packs, diathermy, massage vibration, rest, surgery, 
psychological treatment or drugs. While all of these remedies are useful
 at times, they often do not bring permanent relief <i>if stress in the joint is the real cause of the trouble.</i></p><i>
</i><p align="JUSTIFY">	When the cause <i>is</i> stress in this joint in
 front of the ear, as it often is, a safe and highly successful dental 
treatment may be the solution. This treatment is known as 
"equilibration" (pronounced ee-quil-i-<i>bray</i>-shun); it simply means
 equalizing the muscle forces to restore the lower jaw and its joints to
 their normal unstrained or neutral positions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	How do the joints get out of adjustment in the first
 place? It might be from a blow on the chin, a muscle spasm, or opening 
the jaw too wide (as when biting or yawning). But the most common is 
chewing with teeth that come together in a wrong way.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Dentists refer to this condition as "malocclusion."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	We close our jaws in chewing food, of course — and 
most persons also press their teeth together one or two thousand times a
 day between meals in swallowing. If the teeth do not meet properly, the
 pressures on them during chewing and swallowing may force the lower jaw
 into a strained position that pinches the joints in front of the ears.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	If you could see through the skin and get a side 
view of the TMJ, you would see how the mandible, or lower jaw, hinges to
 the skull. The joint consists of a ball-and-socket arrangement, with 
the ball being a rounded mass of bone in the back part of the lower jaw 
that fits into a socket at the base of the skull. When you open and 
close your jaw, this "ball" rotates in its socket, and — if the teeth 
push the jaw too far in any direction — the soft tissues between the 
bones are pinched.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	One trouble that sometimes follows this pinching is a
 slow loss of hearing, says one authority on TMJ disorders. He cites the
 case of a man who was losing his hearing and had been wearing a hearing
 aid for two years before he learned of equilibration. He had not 
noticed any discomfort at the joints in front of his ears, nor that his 
teeth were not meeting properly, but suspected that his teeth might 
somehow be causing stress. Se he went to his dentist, who made the 
necessary changes on the chewing surfaces of his teeth. Three days 
later, the patient’s hearing had improved to such an extent that he 
discarded his hearing aid. He has not needed it since. That was nine 
years ago, and his hearing is still good.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Not all patients respond so quickly nor so 
completely as that, of course, and there are many other causes of 
deafness, the authority points out — but pressure at the TMJ should not 
be overlooked.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Besides hearing trouble, this authority says, stress
 in the TMJ can cause neuralgia, stiff neck, running ears and itching 
ears. He tells of a woman who suffered from itching ears so much that in
 company she often had to excuse herself from the room to scratch her 
ears. X-ray pictures showed both temporomandibular joints to be out of 
normal adjustment. After her dentist corrected the chewing surfaces of 
her teeth, the itching gradually left. (X-ray pictures showed that the 
joints are now in proper adjustment.) </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	It is not uncommon for stress in the TMJ to bring on
 head noises. A patient who wore artificial dentures in which the teeth 
were out of adjustment, forcing the left side of his jaw backward until 
the joint on that side was under considerable stress, experienced almost
 immediate relief from roaring sounds in his ears after being treated by
 his dentist. This was several years ago, and the roaring sound has not 
returned.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Although the connection between stress in the TMJ 
and the troubles cited is not fully understood, it is known that there 
is a connection, because when the condition in the joint is corrected 
the troubles often disappear.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	How does the dentist restore the joints to a normal 
condition of equilibrium? As part of the treatment he may change the 
slopes of the natural or artificial teeth, or make the teeth higher or 
lower to bring the chewing muscles into proper working relationship. 
Sometimes he reduces pressure on the front teeth so that the chewing 
forces fall more on the back teeth. (If the ball parts of the lower jaw 
have been pushed too far up into their sockets, this "pivoting" allows 
them to settle down again into their normal relaxed positions.)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	As the TMJ authority notes, one advantage of 
equilibration treatment is that it can be done in the dental office and,
 in many instances, saves the patient from the more radical treatments 
of surgery or the injection of chemicals into the joints. Quite often, 
in fact, equilibration is the only treatment needed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	As with other treatment, <i>preventing trouble</i> 
is an important aim of TMJ diagnosis. Because TMJ stress sometimes 
builds up gradually, with the patient suffering no inconvenience at 
first, the lower jaw and its joints are often checked for equilibrium to
 <i>prevent</i> trouble. </p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">If your cancer has caused you to realize the 
importance and magnificence of this temple wherein your soul dwells, you
 have been doubly blessed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If your cancer has caused you to look within and ask the Christ to dwell within you, you have been thrice blessed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Often physical infirmities come to us for such a 
purpose. This was true in my own case. The still, small voice within 
spoke out to guide and teach this Child of God.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Not all who have cancer will overcome the condition. 
Many will not believe that such a simple treatment will work. Many will 
not have the opportunity to hear about and try the procedure. Many will 
come too late with a temple (body) too weak to respond. But, I pray with
 all of you my friends, that you will learn a beautiful lesson and learn
 it well. I did.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Each of God’s children is in an experience in their 
school (earth) each doing the very best he or she can. Jesus said, 
"Judge not, that ye be not judged" (7 Matthew 1); "This is my 
commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you." (15 John 
12).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If your cancer has taught you spiritual truth, you 
have gained much. I pray with you and for you that at this point you 
have come to the realization that your spiritual decision to get well or
 not to get well is your own responsibility. If you decide to go home 
early, rejoice, for the Father prepares a place for you. Those of you 
who have loved ones, who have made this decision, rejoice with them and 
send them on their way into God’s care.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If you decide to stay in school a little longer, this
 is also good and it should now be easier. If you are to operate as a 
perfect being, in perfect health, then you must have a perfect attitude.
 You must become aware of the spiritual power within that is greater 
than you, the still, small voice within.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">If you are of the many millions of people who have 
been told that you have cancer and that your days are numbered, then it 
is you who must be interested enough to seek out the truth of your 
condition. You have read many things in this treatise, which bring new 
thinking to a very old disease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Since we are dealing with the metabolic approach to 
cancer, we must consider not only the physical, but also the mental and 
spiritual laws of God. We need help from those around us as well as the 
God power within to reverse our thinking, and attain that balance which 
creates a healthy physical being.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As stated in previous chapters, half measures will 
avail you nothing. You are at the point where you must ask God for 
guidance. These are the steps, which are suggested as a method of 
spiritual recovery:</p>
<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Accept the fact that you are afflicted with a symptom (malignant cancer) and that recovery is possible.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Establish a faith in a power greater than yourself and know that with His help you can regain health and harmony.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Make the decision to turn your will and your life over to the care of God.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Conduct a complete self-analysis to better understand your own emotions.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Admit to God, to yourself, and to others the exact nature of what you find to be your shortcomings.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Be willing to give up what you are doing wrong.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Seek through prayer to improve your conscious
 contact with God. Pray only for knowledge of His will for you and the 
strength to carry that out.</li><p></p></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">	Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of this action, practice these principles in your every thought.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Just as the body must be purged and cleansed, so must
 the emotions and spirit be purified. This is a comparatively simple 
task to accomplish, but do not lull yourself into believing that it is 
an easy task. Rigorous self-discipline and the ability to grasp and 
develop a manner of living with complete honesty in all of your actions 
and thought are necessary. You must become strong willed to be a winner 
in accomplishing that which you set out to do for yourself. You will 
look for all the good in everything and refuse to accept any negation.</p>

types, which are named "Metabolic Types One through Ten." By classifying
 each person into their own proper type, it is possible to determine 
accurately what vitamins, minerals, foods, and other supplements would 
best support his or her own body chemistry. Equally important, it is 
possible to know what supplements and foods they should <b><i>not</i></b>
 have. With the knowledge of these factors, it is possible to design a 
program that has the fullest potential. All people fall into one of the 
metabolic types, that is to say they fall into one of the basic ways the
 body functions. Each person’s body takes in food, water and air. How a 
person uses these raw materials to maintain life differs from one person
 to another. This function of maintaining life is called metabolism and 
is normally defined as the sum total of all the chemical reactions 
occurring in the body.</p>

autonomic nervous system controls such activities as our heartbeat, 
respiration and reflexes (like what happens when a person sits on a

<p align="JUSTIFY">The autonomic nervous system regulates the basic 
life-sustaining functions of the body such as the turning on and off of 
glands and organs, maintaining the acid/alkaline balance of the blood, 
saliva, and urine, digestion of food, balancing glandular functions, 
turning the cells on and off, and stimulating and retarding the body and
 its parts. </p>

beat a little fast. Constipation is an ever-present plague. Frequently 
insomnia is a problem. Tension, hyperactivity and drive are their 
plight.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Of this group, Metabolic Type Six’s 
require the most nutritional support, the greatest number and strength 
of vitamins, minerals, enzymes and other nutritional factors that help 
the vegetarian type. Type One’s require the second greatest nutritional 
support. Type One’s need the support that slows down the sympathetic 
nervous system and speeds up the parasympathetic nervous system. Type 
Four metabolizers need the least nutritional support of this vegetarian 
class — they are the closest of the three to becoming balanced type 
metabolizers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For nutritional support, Sympathetic Dominant 
Metabolizers most often need: Vitamin D; Vitamin K; Ascorbic Acid; 
Biotin; Folic Acid; Vitamins B1, B2 and B6; PABA; Niacin; Potassium; 
Magnesium; Manganese; Zinc; Chromium; Hydrochloric Acid; Pancreatic 
Enzymes and Amino Acids. Each of the vegetarian Types (One, Four and 
Six) need these supplements, but each type needs different amounts and 
different ratios.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type One metabolizers come the closest of 
all the types to being purely sympathetic dominant people. One of the 
chief characteristics of Type One metabolizers is that they can burn 
carbohydrates slowly. Their bodies utilize the carbohydrates poorly and 
they are able to maintain their blood sugar level with very little 
fluctuation. If anything, their blood sugar level stays a little 
elevated. With this condition, they can eat mostly fruits and 
vegetables, maintaining their health and feeling well. These people are 
what are commonly called vegetarians. They very seldom if ever crave 
meats (except fish) and when they eat meat, they usually feel groggy and
 have a loss of energy. These people do not do well on lamb, venison, 
beef, sardines or salmon. They can do quite well on up to 100% of their 
diet raw. They should stress the following foods: whole grains including
 spaghetti, macaroni, breads, cereals; raw (unpasteurized) goats’ milk, 
eggs; white fish. They may use spices, 2-3 cups of coffee (non-instant),
 herbal tea, or an occasional alcoholic beverage or sweet dessert (made 
with unrefined sugar or raw, unheated honey). They enjoy and do well on 
nuts and seeds; rice; fruits and vegetables like apples, apricots, 
bananas, berries, grapes, oranges, pears, plums, grapefruit, asparagus, 
lima beans, beet tops, cucumbers, sprouts, lettuce, collards, dandelion 
greens, kale, mustard, turnip greens, spinach, and any leafy green 
vegetable.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type Four metabolizers are people who have
 strong sympathetic nervous systems but not nearly as strong as the Type
 One’s. Type Four’s are a little more balanced or non-strict 
vegetarians. These people usually have a genetic background of their 
ancestors coming from around the Mediterranean Sea — Spanish, Italian, 
Greek, Israeli, Arabic, etc. Type Four’s burn or metabolize their 
carbohydrates and sugars a little faster than the Type One’s. The Type 
Four’s that tend toward having diabetes can normally control it with 
diet alone.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To maintain optimum health, Type Four’s do well on 
fish, chicken, turkey, other fowl, beef (two times a week), almost all 
vegetables, a little fruit, sprouts, some citrus, eggs, and raw, 
(unpasteurized) goats’ milk. Most American "vegetarians" fall into this 
class. Type Six’s generally need about 60% of their food raw. They 
normally do not need as much nutritional support in the form of 
nutritional supplements as the Types One and Six.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type Six metabolizers are people who are 
basically sympathetic dominant. They fall into the vegetarian class of 
metabolizers. Type Six’s are very poor metabolizers — that is, they take
 in their food and nothing much happens. Their bodies do not utilize 
their food and they get very little energy from it and are generally 
sickly. Their assimilation or utilization of food is about 20% of 
normal. They almost always feel bad or not up to par. Type Six’s need 
about 60% of their food cooked. They need a great deal of supplemental 
nutritional support. They require more hydrochloric acid, vitamins, 
minerals, enzymes, etc. than either Types Four or One.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Type Six metabolizers should give care to the intake 
of whole and complete natural foods. All refined, processed, synthetic 
foods and additives must be avoided at all times. Type Six people do 
best when they stress the following foods in their diets: adequate 
amounts of fruits and vegetables including lettuce, green vegetables, 
onions, radishes, potatoes; whole grains including spaghetti, macaroni, 
breads; gelatin and other desserts made with raw sugar or unheated 
honey; natural jams, jellies, ice creams, mushrooms, nuts, seeds, and 
seafood and fowl, which should be preferred over other meats.   </p>

 strong function of the posterior pituitary, hypothalamus, parotid,

some of the same nutritional support as do the vegetarian types, but for
 the most part, they need entirely different vitamins, minerals and 
foods.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Type Seven’s need more nutritional support than 
types Two and Five. Type Two’s have such strong parasympathetic 
dominance that they need almost as much support as Type Seven’s. Type 
Five metabolizers are more balanced and their supplemental support is 
not as much as the Types Two and Seven.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Parasympathetic dominant metabolizers most often 
need such nutritional support as: Vitamins E and B-12; Niacinamide, 
Pantothenic Acid, Choline, Inositol, Calcium, Phosphorus, Calcium 
Ascorbate, Bioflavonoid Complex, Zinc and Ribonucleic Acid. These 
metabolizers should eat at bedtime enough to carry them through the 
night. They should not eat leafy green vegetables or take large 
quantities of the B vitamins.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362565"></a><a name="_Toc430363858"></a><a name="_Toc434239952">Metabolic Type Two</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">	Type Two metabolizers come the closest of
 all the types to being purely parasympathetic dominant people. One of 
the chief characteristics of Type Two metabolizers is that they burn 
carbohydrates very rapidly. Their pancreases work so well that 
carbohydrates and sugars burn or metabolize so rapidly that these people
 have a tendency to develop hypoglycemia — low blood sugar. When they 
eat only fruits, vegetables and sweets, their blood sugar rises and 
drops many times a day and their energy goes up and down like a yo-yo. 
When Type Two’s eat carbohydrates and sugars, which are metabolized so 
quickly, they become very weak and shaky after a spurt of energy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Type Two metabolizers must have meat — preferably 
fatty, heavy, high purine meats such as lamb, beef, salmon, and 
sardines. They are usually the people who order their steaks very rare. 
By eating these fatty meats, they slow down their carbohydrate/sugar 
metabolisms. They feel they have eaten something that will "stick to 
their ribs." Their energy is released at a normal rate and they don’t 
suffer the ups and downs energy-wise that fruits and sweets cause them 
to have. Normally, these metabolizers don’t care much for sweets. They 
do well on root vegetables, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, 
carrot juice, and beans. They enjoy butter, cream, Danish pastries, 
cream puffs and foods with cream or butter added. They can do well by 
adding a small amount of whole grains.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Type Two people do very poorly on leafy green 
vegetables, candies, fruits, sweets, high carbohydrate diets and sugar 
pastries. They should limit the B vitamins and intake of potassium 
supplements. Type Two metabolizers usually have a genetic background 
from German, Scandinavian and Northern European ancestry.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type Five metabolizers are those persons 
who have strong parasympathetic nervous systems, but not nearly as 
strong as Type Two metabolizers. Type Five metabolizers are more toward 
the normal or balanced metabolism. They can tolerate a wide variety of 
foods. Type Five metabolizers do well on beef or lamb several times a 
week, seafood, salmon, tuna, raw (unpasteurized) goat cheese, avocado, 
beans, peas, lentils, celery, carrots, asparagus, butter, whole grain 
cereals and breads, some nuts and occasionally Danish pastry and raw 
(unpasteurized) goats’ milk cheesecake.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Type Five metabolizers are not as prone to 
hypoglycemia as are the Type Two metabolizers. However, Type Five’s can 
easily develop hypoglycemia if they indulge in too many candies and 
sweets. Many Americans fall into this class and do not do well as 
vegetarians.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type Seven metabolizers are the sickly, 
weak, inefficient parasympathetic metabolizers. Their bodies do not 
utilize their food well and as a result they function very poorly. They 
almost always feel bad or sickly, functioning very sluggishly. It is 
difficult for them to maintain adequate nutrition to their individual 
body cells. Their body chemistry systems are quite inefficient and more 
than normal supplementation must be maintained at all times. Care must 
be given to the intake of whole and complete natural foods. All refined,
 processed, synthetic food and food additives must be avoided 
constantly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Type Seven metabolizers are encouraged to stress the 
following foods in their diets: seafoods, sardines, salmon, brains, 
liver, heart, meat gravies and soups, non-colored unprocessed 
(unpasteurized) goat cheeses, beans, lentils, carrots, celery, butter, 
and cauliflower. Small amounts of Danish pastries, raw (unpasteurized) 
goats’ milk cheesecake and an occasional alcoholic beverage may be 
taken. Type Seven metabolizers function best on purine meats such as 
salmon, tuna, beef, lamb, and wild game. These meats should be preferred
 over others and used whenever possible and practical. Care should be 
given to adequately detoxify the bodies of these metabolizers. </p>

which are neither strongly meat eating nor strongly vegetarian — they 
fall in the middle. They are both vegetarian and meat eating. 
Metabolizers in this category have the greatest freedom in what they can
 eat. Indeed, they enjoy and thrive equally on foods from both the 
vegetarian and meat-eating categories.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The balanced metabolizers burn their food neither too
 fast nor too slow. This is one of the reasons they do equally well on 
all varieties of food.</p>

Calcium, Phosphorus, Magnesium, Manganese, Chromium and Zinc. Each of 
the balanced Types Three, Five, Nine and Ten needs these supplements but
 each type needs different amounts and in different ratios. They also 
require extra amounts of Hydrochloric Acid and Pancreatic Enzymes. </p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Balanced metabolizers have different needs
 and requirements depending upon which type they are. Generally however,
 they do well on a large variety of food.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362572"></a><a name="_Toc430363865"></a><a name="_Toc434239959">Metabolic Type Three</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type Three metabolizers are balanced 
metabolizers. That is, their sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous 
systems are functioning in balance equally well. However, Type Three 
metabolizers come with bodies that are very inefficient. No matter what 
foods or supplements they take in, they are generally only going to use 
about 10% to 15% of them. Type Three metabolizers find it difficult for 
their individual cells to obtain adequate nutrition. All refined, 
processed, synthetic foods and food additives must be avoided at all 
times. Type Three metabolizers of necessity must take larger quantities 
of nutritional supplementation to maintain their nutritional health than
 any other type. They must eat food prepared in such a manner as to be 
easily digested. They should have a wide variety of foods, which enables
 them to get the wide spectrum of nutrients their bodies require.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Type Three (and Six and Seven) metabolizers are 
generally those with the poorest health. They have to keep constant 
vigilance over their diet and supplements. Generally they have inherited
 weak, defective bodies and very rarely will they ever have good health 
and feel really well if they are not extremely cautious.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, due to the stress of modern living and
 agribusiness, more and more Americans who have inherited good bodies 
have so exhausted and destroyed their bodies that they are now 
functioning in the Type Three (or Six and Seven) range. It would take 
supreme effort to rebuild and repair these bodies and put them back into
 normal optimum health again.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362573"></a><a name="_Toc430363866"></a><a name="_Toc434239960">Metabolic Type Eight</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type Eight metabolizers account for the 
greatest number of people. More Americans are Type eight than any other 
metabolic type. Type Eight metabolizers have fairly healthy bodies. 
Their bodies can adapt to a wide variety of stresses and yet remain 
stable. Their autonomic nervous systems also have a wide range of 
adaptability. Type Eight people need a wide variety of foods each day. 
This permits them to attempt to obtain a large variety of nutrients 
required to operate their bodies efficiently. Nutritional supplements, 
like their food, must cover a wide spectrum.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362574"></a><a name="_Toc430363867"></a><a name="_Toc434239961">Metabolic Type Nine</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type Nine metabolizers are in the balanced
 class — their sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems work 
equally well. This type is the most difficult to understand. If these 
people had a choice, they would always prefer cooked food. Working with 
these people through the years has led to the conclusion that they truly
 cannot do well on raw foods. Evidently they have mutated to the point 
that they need cooked food to be satisfied. They generally require 70% 
cooked food and can comfortably handle 30% raw food. Type nine 
metabolizers do best when they can eat at Smorgasbord three or four 
times a week. In other words, if they eat a little of everything, they 
function best.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362575"></a><a name="_Toc430363868"></a><a name="_Toc434239962">Metabolic Type Ten</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Type Ten metabolizers are the people with 
balanced and super efficient metabolisms. They need a wide variety of 
foods and supplements, but they do not require a large quantity of 
anything. Their bodies are so incredibly efficient that they need very 
small amounts of food. If they eat a normal meal, they feel more than 
satisfied. They can eat half as much as any other metabolic type. They 
do well on any food but often prefer raw fruits, vegetables, whole 
grains and unpasteurized goat cheese.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley developed his Self-Test for the
 Different Metabolic Types to help bridge the gap of research to 
practical application. He realized that the overall state of health of 
this nation could no longer be maintained acceptable unless the 
nutritional needs of the people were brought into immediate and sharp 
focus. No one (doctor or patient) knows what a well-balanced meal is. 
Doctors have not been trained along these disciplines, nor do they have 
the time or inclination to educate themselves in these areas.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In order to make the most efficient use of research 
data, it must be related and applied directly to each individual to meet
 his specific needs. The problem then arises as to which data is 
significant for each patient. Dr. Kelley had to develop a system to 
accomplish this. It was decided that the most practical system would be 
an extensive questionnaire: Dr. Kelley’s Self-Test for the Different 
Metabolic Types. The test is bound in a book that contains hundreds of 
health questions. It includes complete instructions so you can score the
 results yourself (the results are compiled on an as-you-go basis during
 the completion of the questionnaire). </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Taking the time (it takes a few hours) to complete 
the questionnaire will tell you whether you are a meat-eater, a 
vegetarian, or have a balanced metabolism. It will tell you which types 
of meats, fruits, and vegetables you should eat. Furthermore, it will 
tell you what supplements you should take, and, perhaps even more 
important, which you should avoid.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When you complete the questionnaire and follow the 
directions at the end of the book for scoring your answers, you will 
know where your body, at the present time, is functioning. There are 
three main metabolic types (Vegetarian, Carnivore and Balanced), and a 
number of sub-types (three in Vegetarian, three in Carnivore and four in
 Balanced). Each person will know exactly which of the three main types 
they are functioning in and also which sub-type.   </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After one follows the nutritional guidelines at the 
back of the questionnaire for their metabolic type for a few weeks or 
months they will want to take the Self-Test again to determine if their 
metabolism has switched to another type. Everyone should recheck their 
metabolic type every six months to a year, because it can change. If and
 when it does, one’s diet and supplemental program will have to be 
changed accordingly.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As one improves their blood chemistry, it’s possible 
for their nervous system to go into balance — giving them a balanced 
metabolism. This can take years, or it may never happen. However, I 
wouldn’t worry about it if it doesn’t happen. As long as you’re healthy 
and functioning normally — that’s what counts.</p>

</font></b><font size="2"><p align="JUSTIFY">This is what we call the 
Metabolic Type Chart. It shows all 10 metabolic types and their 
relationship to each other, their sympathetic or their parasympathetic 
dominance and their metabolic efficiency. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the left side are listed the sympathetic dominant 
types 1, 4, and 6. On the right side are listed the parasympathetic 
types 2, 5, and 7. And in the center column are listed the balanced 
types 10, 8, 9 and 3; these have a little of both sympathetic and 
parasympathetic dominating.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">These 10 types are arranged on the Metabolic Type 
Chart on what might be called two sliding scales — one of them running 
horizontal and the other running vertical.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The horizontal scale runs from the extremely 
sympathetic type 1 to the more balanced but still sypathetic type 4 to 
the balanced type 8 to the parasympathetic type 5 to the extremely 
parasymathetic type 2. Ideally one should have a more balanced type of 
metabolism with good qualities from both sides.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Striking a balance between sympathetic and 
parasympathetic isn’t all that is desirable. It is also important to 
have a good, strong metabolism capable of utilizing raw materials with 
maximum efficiency. The vertical scale shows the scale from the 
exceptionally strong metabolizer type 10 to the good metabolizer type 8 
to the poor sympathetic metabolizer type 6 to the poor parasympathetic 
metabolizer type 7 to the poor balanced metabolizer type 9 to the 
poorest metabolizer of all, type 3. The type 3 metabolizer only 
assimilates about 10% of what he or she eats. </p>

Eating and Taking Supplements<br>
According to Your Metabolic Type</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">As you follow a properly balanced 
nutritional program, changes begin to happen within your body. Often 
this is alarming and not at all what you expected to happen.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362586"></a><a name="_Toc430363879"></a><a name="_Toc434239973">The Ideal Reaction</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The ideal reaction is the gradual 
development of an increased "sense of well-being." At first you will 
notice you do not tire so easily. You "last" longer during the day, and 
you do not become tired so early in the evening. Next, you find you are 
not so tired in the mornings. You look forward to the new day and may 
awaken earlier. As your sense of well-being increases, you begin to feel
 more emotionally and psychologically secure. Little things do not 
bother you as they once did. Your old habit patterns begin to change 
from "grumpy" ones to "happy" ones.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362587"></a><a name="_Toc430363880"></a><a name="_Toc434239974">Adverse Reactions</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The ideal reaction often occurs, but more 
frequently there is a multitude of uncomfortable reactions, which 
normally come first, as your body chemistry begins to change. These 
reactions should not alarm you or cause undue apprehension. Any one or 
all of the following reactions may occur:</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362588"></a><a name="_Toc430363881"></a><a name="_Toc434239975">Toxic Reactions</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">After about two or three of weeks eating 
and taking supplements according to your metabolic type it is normal to 
experience toxic reactions. You will gradually lose your appetite, 
become nauseated and may even develop a "toxic headache." Occasionally, 
you may also experience swelling in the various lymph glands throughout 
your body. The normal cells cleaning debris from the system faster than 
the liver, kidneys, skin and lungs can remove them from the body bring 
about these toxic reactions. At this point you can do two things to 
help:</p>
<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Discontinue the supplements for no more than a
 five-day period. Continue the supplements again for ten to 25 days. 
This cycle of five days off and ten or more days on may have to be 
repeated several times, depending upon the depleted condition of your 
body and the amount of repair which is needed at the cellular level.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Take a coffee enema to stimulate the 
excretion of toxins. The procedure for this is explained earlier in this
 book. One or two a day may be taken depending upon the severity of the 
toxic condition. In an extreme toxic reaction, both the discontinuance 
of supplements and the coffee enema should be used.  </li><p></p></ol>

<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362589"></a><a name="_Toc430363882"></a><a name="_Toc434239976">Allergic Reactions</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes you may experience an allergic 
reaction. This is particularly true when the hydrochloric acid in the 
stomach is deficient and/or when the liver and adrenal glands are in a 
state of dysfunction or extreme exhaustion. The allergic reaction is 
similar to the toxic condition. You may just not feel well, be nauseated
 and/or even develop a skin rash, shortness of breath, etc. Taking too 
many supplements at once for the first time can bring this about. If you
 tend to be allergic, you should start your supplemental program by 
taking only one supplement for three days, than adding the second one. 
Continue both for three more days, then add the third supplement. In 
three days, add the next one and so forth, until you can tolerate the 
complete suggested supplemental program.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">As you begin to physiologically balance 
your body chemistry, other reactions may take place. It is not easy to 
change from lifelong habits of faulty eating of devitalized, processed 
foods to a new system of eating natural, life-giving foods and taking 
individualized needed supplements.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Following this metabolic program should bring about a
 readjustment of body chemistry. The body, meeting this changing 
situation, often responds in surprising ways to this process. The longer
 the deficiencies have existed, the more prevalent the response is 
likely to be. Additional reactions may occur as the body adapts and 
stabilizes. The reactions that often occur are: </p>

<ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Canker sores</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Constipation</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Craving for unusual foods </li><p></p>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Various body aches and pains, both in the joints and muscles. </li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Weakness</li><p></p></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">When these reactions occur, you can be assured your 
body is responding and changes are taking place. If you think of these 
as correcting crises, it will be easy to accept them as steps on the 
road to better health. If they occur, they are only temporary and are 
but a small price to pay for the long-lasting benefits.  </p>

</font></b><i><p align="JUSTIFY">Hodgkin’s disease is a moderately rare cancer of the lymphocyte system and associated organs that claimed 1,500 lives in 1987.</p>
</i><p align="JUSTIFY">Physicians classify this malignancy by a claimed 
1,500 system of four "stages" (I-IV). Stage I represents early, 
localized disease; stage IV defines advanced, widely disseminated cancer
 involving many organs of the body. Stages II and III include more 
intermediate forms. Physicians further categorize Hodgkin’s disease by 
the letters "A" and "B." The designation "A" refers to patients without 
symptoms. The letter "B" identifies patients with symptoms such as 
fevers, chills, night sweats, and fatigue. Hodgkin’s, if untreated, is 
often rapidly fatal. "A single series of untreated patients reported by 
Croft in 1941," writes Devita, head of the National Cancer Institute, 
"leads us to believe that the course of patients with Hodgkin’s disease,
 if left untreated, regardless of the stage, is brief, measured in 1 to 2
 years. In that series, the median survival was less than 1 year and 
most patients were dead by year 2, with fewer than 5% alive after 5 
years." At present, the "MOPP" chemotherapy regimen is the most widely 
recommended treatment for Hodgkin’s. This protocol employs four drugs — 
nitrogen mustard, Oncovin (vincristine), procarbazine and prednisone — 
given once every twenty-eight days for at least six months. As Devita 
explains, "Unless chemotherapy is contraindicated for medical reasons, 
all patients treated with MOPP and other combinations should be given a 
minimum of six cycles (a dose) or as many cycles as needed to achieve a 
complete remission, plus additional cycles to consolidate the 
remission."(1) With protocols such as this, at least 50% of all patients
 will survive five years.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Michael Moreland is a 37-year old man 
from Washington State alive nine years since diagnosed with Hodgkin’s 
disease. In late 1977, Mr. Moreland developed mild fatigue and a tender 
swelling in his neck that rapidly increased in size. In January of 1978 
he consulted his family physician, who suspected a low-grade infection 
and prescribed a course of Penicillin therapy. With treatment, the 
swelling did decrease slightly over a period of a week, but then 
worsened. In addition, Mr. Moreland began experiencing drenching night 
sweats as well as sharp pain in the upper part of his chest. Several 
weeks later, Mr. Moreland returned to his physician. A chest X-ray 
revealed a large upper mediastinal mass, and laboratory studies were 
significant for an elevated white blood count of 21,000 (upper limit of 
normal 10,000). Because of these findings, on February 6, 1978 Mr. 
Moreland entered Vancouver Memorial Hospital in Vancouver, Washington. 
On admission, Mr. Moreland was noted to have extensive lymphadenopathy 
in the cervical area, described in the records as: "A very large mass 
present in the left side of the neck with some surrounding smaller 
masses also present. There are some more discrete masses on the right 
side as well, measuring up to 3 to 4 centimeters in diameter. There is a
 bilateral auxiliary adenopathy present." The following day, Mr. 
Moreland went to surgery. Subsequent evaluation of the tissue specimen 
confirmed an aggressive form of Hodgkin’s disease, well-described in the
 official pathology report: "There is no question that nodules are being
 formed in this lymph node but in many areas the picture is more than a 
mixed cellularity type and there are remarkably large collections 
composed mainly of malignant reticulohitiocytic cells with lymphocyte 
depletion." With a diagnosis of Hodgkin’s confirmed Mr. Moreland was 
readmitted to Vancouver Memorial on February 13 for additional tests. A 
chest X-ray showed: "Mediastinal adenopathy which is a little more 
pronounced on the right. There is evidence of bilateral cervical nodes."
 A lymphangiogram, a dye study of the abdominal lymph node system, 
demonstrated extensive disease, as summarized in the records: "Abnormal 
lymphangiogram due to enlarged nodes caused by Hodgkin’s disease at L2, 
L3 and probably along the right iliac chain."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On February 13, Mr. Moreland underwent a staging 
laparotomy — exploratory abdominal surgery — and removal of his spleen, a
 procedure often performed in patients with Hodgkin’s. Although the 
spleen was free of disease, a periaortic lymph node was positive for 
cancer. At the same time, a bone marrow biopsy was attempted, but the 
specimen could not be conclusively analyzed. Mr. Moreland was told he 
suffered advanced Hodgkin’s disease, officially recorded as: "Hodgkin’s 
disease, nodular sclerosed type, stage IIIB." His doctors advised that 
aggressive multi-agent chemotherapy was the only hope for prolonged 
survival, and proposed their standard six-month, six-cycle course of 
MOPP. Mr. Moreland agreed to the treatment, which he began in late 
February as an outpatient at the Vancouver Clinic.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After the first round of drugs, Mr. Moreland became 
extremely weak, fatigued, and anorexic. His symptoms did improve over a 
two-week period, but while undergoing the second cycle, Mr. Moreland 
became severely ill. He did struggle through a third course, but felt so
 debilitated he decided to discontinue chemotherapy. The attending 
physician warned Mr. Moreland that without appropriate treatment, he 
would quickly die, and suggested a six-month course of radiation as an 
alternative. Mr. Moreland accepted the plan and in late May received his
 first dose of cobalt to the chest.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Once again Mr. Moreland became ill, and in mid-July, 
after receiving a total of 4060 rads to the chest and upper abdomen, Mr.
 Moreland refused further treatment. At the same time, he was not 
believed to be cancer-free. According to Mr. Moreland, his doctors 
warned that he would die within a year, unless he agreed to additional 
therapy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Moreland did not change his mind. Instead, after 
investigating alternative approaches to cancer, he met with Dr. Kelley 
in late July and shortly thereafter began the Kelley program. Within a 
month, he noticed improved energy and well being, and within a year, he 
says he felt better than he had for a decade.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Moreland followed the full regimen for three 
years, and today, nine years since his diagnosis, he remains in 
excellent health. He also has two healthy children, currently, aged four
 and six; this is unusual, since MOPP chemotherapy causes sterility in a
 majority of male patients. Despite his abbreviated courses of both 
chemotherapy and radiation, I believe Mr. Moreland is a relatively 
simple case to evaluate. Although there are, in the medical literature, 
several documented instances of patients with advanced Hodgkin’s 
enjoying prolonged survival after incomplete treatment with MOPP, such 
cases are extremely rare. While he did undergo radiotherapy, all of it 
was directed to his chest and upper abdomen. His extensive lower 
abdominal and pelvic tumors were never irradiated.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In summary, Mr. Moreland suffered Stage IIIB 
Hodgkin’s disease, treated with partial courses of chemotherapy and 
radiation. When first seen by Dr. Kelley, he was clinically debilitated 
and not, according to his doctors, in remission; it seems reasonable to 
attribute this patient’s prolonged survival and current good health to 
his nutritional protocol.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Stirling is a 53-year-old Canadian, 
alive 27 years since developing Hodgkin’s disease. In January of 1971, 
Mr. Stirling noticed a swelling on the left side of his neck. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">He consulted his local physician who believed the lesion to be a benign cyst, and no additional evaluation was recommended.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Over the following year, the swelling fluctuated in 
size. Finally, when his neck enlarged dramatically in June of 1972, Mr. 
Stirling returned to his doctor, and was admitted to Reddy Memorial 
Hospital in Toronto. Mr. Stirling subsequently went to surgery for 
removal of the presumed cyst. However, the mass proved to be a matted 
collection of cancerous lymph nodes, fifteen of which were found 
positive for nodular sclerosing Hodgkin’s disease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Stirling was transferred to Princess Margaret 
Hospital for further study and treatment. Serial X-rays of the 
mediastinum (mid-chest) showed no evidence of metastatic disease, but 
additional X-rays confirmed extension of cancer throughout the pelvis, 
described in the radiology report as ". . . filling defects and dilated 
intranodal and peripheral sinusoids in the paraortic nodes on the left. 
These changes are typical of early involvement by Hodgkin’s disease."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A bone scan demonstrated abnormalities in the pelvic 
region consistent with metastases, summarized as: "Increased deposition 
of activity in the left side of the pelvis and the left sacroiliac 
joint. Appearance suggests the possibility of an abnormality of this 
site."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A liver-spleen scan revealed an enlarged spleen, and a
 liver infiltrated with tumor. The records describe: "Appearances on the
 anterior and right lateral scans are strongly suggestive of the 
presence of a space occupying lesion located in the anterior right lobe 
(of the liver) — There is also poor concentration of activity within the
 left lobe, suggesting the presence of an extensive infiltrating lesion.
 The spleen is moderately enlarged."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The standard six-month, six-cycle MOPP chemotherapy 
protocol was recommended. After agreeing to the treatment plan, Mr. 
Stirling received his first round of MOPP as an inpatient on June 30, 
1972. He tolerated the chemotherapy without significant side effects, 
and was discharged from the hospital in early July. But after the second
 course of drugs, Mr. Stirling developed severe weakness, fatigue and 
anorexia. He did eventually recover, and returned to the hospital for a 
third round of MOPP in late August. While being treated, Mr. Stirling 
again became very ill, and insisted the chemotherapy be stopped. At the 
time of discharge several days later, he was told he most probably would
 not live a year.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Stirling then began a long automobile trip 
through the United States. In September of 1972, while staying with 
friends in Arizona, he quite by chance learned of Dr. Kelley’s work. 
Several days later, he was on the road again, heading for Dallas and an 
appointment with Dr. Kelley. Within a week, Mr. Stirling had begun the 
full Kelley regimen.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Shortly after, the lymph nodes in his neck and 
auxiliary regions suddenly enlarged, within a period of months, the 
swelling regressed, and today, 27 years after his diagnosis, he still 
follows the Kelley Program, remains cancer-free and is in excellent 
health. Although a single course of MOPP can cause sterility, Mr. 
Stirling now has two children of his own and a third by marriage.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In summary, Mr. Stirling suffered widely metastatic, 
stage IV Hodgkin’s disease. After an abbreviated course of MOPP, the 
disease recurred explosively. However, Mr. Stirling’s cancer went into 
remission, apparently for good, as he pursued only the Kelley Program. 
Update December 1998; Scott and family are doing fine, cancer free, 
healthy and happy in San Diego.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Philip Bonfiglio is a 52 year-old man 
from Ohio, who has survived 13 years since his diagnosis of metastatic 
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In early 1974, Mr. Bonfiglio, a heavy smoker, 
developed a persistent upper respiratory infection and cough. He 
consulted his family doctor, who prescribed a course of antibiotic 
therapy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Despite the treatment, the symptoms only worsened, 
and in March Mr. Bonfiglio returned to his physician. At that time a 
chest X-ray revealed a 3-centimeter (cm) mass in the upper lobe of the 
right lung.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bonfiglio was admitted to Akron City hospital on 
April 7, 1974, and the following day went for exploratory chest surgery.
 He was found to have a large inoperable tumor in the right lung that 
had metastasized to many lymph nodes. These findings are clearly 
described in the operative note: "A tumor approximately 4 cm in greatest
 diameter was found in the periphery of the posterior segment of the 
right upper lobe (of the lung). In the area below the azygos vein were 
multiple nodes, which extended posteriorly up along the vena cave and 
acquired a maximum diameter of about 3.5-cm. Because of the massive 
involvement of the mediastinum, curative resection was not feasible."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Evaluation of a biopsy specimen confirmed: "Poorly 
differentiated carcinoma consistent with squamous cell type." In 
addition, all lymph nodes removed at surgery were positive for 
metastatic disease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bonfiglio’s doctors recommended a course of 
cobalt radiation treatment, which he began while still hospitalized. 
Nevertheless, he was told that even with such treatment, his chances of 
surviving one year were dim.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the discharge summary, the attending physician 
wrote: ". . . The patient, due to the metastatic nature of this 
carcinoma does have a poor prognosis."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Bonfiglio completed the suggested regimen of 5000
 rads to the lungs as an outpatient. When the tumors continued to grow 
despite the radiation, a course of intensive chemotherapy was proposed. 
But since his disease was believed incurable, Mr. Bonfiglio refused all 
further orthodox treatment. Instead, Mr. Bonfiglio decided to 
investigate unconventional cancer therapies. He soon learned of Kelley, 
consulted with him and began the Kelley program in late spring.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Over a several month period, his persistent 
respiratory symptoms resolved, and within a year, Mr. Bonfiglio says he 
felt better than he had for a decade.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Today, 13 years after his diagnosis, Mr. Bonfiglio 
still follows his nutritional protocol and is in excellent health with 
no sign of his once metastatic disease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is one of the 
most deadly of cancers. The five year survival rate for patients with 
stage III disease, regardless of treatment, is less than 5%.(1) Stanely 
reports a median survival of only 24-27 weeks in 32 symptomatic 
patients, such as Mr. Bonfiglio, with unresectable tumors.(2) </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In summary, Mr. Bonfiglio suffered inoperable, mestastatic lung cancer, which did not respond to a course of cobalt therapy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It therefore seems appropriate to attribute this patient’s long-term survival to the Kelley program.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Robert Beesley is a 67 year-old man 
from Iowa who has survived nearly 12 years since his diagnosis of 
metastatic colon cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In mid-1975, Mr. Beesley first became fatigued, and 
developed severe constipation alternating with episodes of watery 
diarrhea. Some months later, after noticing bright red blood in his 
stool, he consulted his family physician who referred him for tests at a
 local clinic.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At that time, a barium enema revealed a large, 5.7-cm. mass in the right colon, which was believed to be consistent with cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On July 7, 1975, Mr. Beesley was admitted to Iowa 
Methodist Medical Center for further evaluation. A liver-spleen scan was
 Positive for a "suspicious defect of the left lobe of the liver." It 
measured approximately 2.5 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Other studies, however, including chest X-rays, 
showed no sign of metastatic disease. The following day Mr. Beesley went
 to surgery for removal of the right half of his large intestine.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In addition to the colon tumor, he was found to have 
unresectable metastases in both lobes of the liver, described in the 
operative note as "two lesions in the liver, one in the right and one in
 the left lobe of the liver." The right one was larger than the left, 
measuring about 2 by 2 cms.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Review of the specimen confirmed a fulminant grade 
III Adenocarcinoma extending into the adjacent tissues, as described in 
the formal pathology report: 	"The rectal pouch is filled with bulky 
ulcerated neoplasm, which is almost completely circumferential measuring
 10 by 6 by 2 cm. Tumor infiltrates directly into the contiguous 
mesentery (the tissues adjacent to the large intestine)" — Mr. Beesley 
was told he might live three to six months, at most.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The attending physicians, believing him beyond cure, recommended neither chemotherapy nor radiation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After leaving the hospital on July 21, 1975, Mr. 
Beesley decided to investigate unorthodox approaches to cancer. Later 
that summer, he learned of Dr. Kelley, consulted with him and began the 
Kelley program. Mr. Beesley continued the full Kelley regimen for seven 
years before tapering down to a maintenance program, which he still 
follows. Today, despite the initial terminal prognosis, he is in 
excellent health and cancer-free. Although he has not been formally 
evaluated since his original surgery 12 years ago, Mr. Beesley believes 
his continued survival is proof enough of his cure. Colon cancer, when 
metastatic to the liver, is invariably rapidly fatal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Pestana and colleagues at the Mayo Clinic report a 
mean survival of only 9.0 months in 353 patients presented with liver 
involvement.(1)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In similar studies, Bengmark describes an average 
survival of only 7.8 months(2), and Morris a median survival of 11.4 
months.(3)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Obviously, Mr. Beesley’s progress represents a most unusual outcome for this disease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As a footnote to this case, the author was surprised 
to learn that supporters of Lawrence Burton, an unconventional therapist
 with a clinic in the Bahamas, had been advertising Mr. Beesley as a 
"Burton Success." When I mentioned these reports to Mr. Beesley, he 
explained that he received several weeks of Burton Therapy in the fall 
of 1975 — after he had already improved significantly on the Kelley 
program.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, Mr. Beesley claims he never finished the
 prescribed Burton protocol, and never received any further treatment 
from Burton. Mr. Beesley himself attributes his recovery to his many 
years on the Kelley regimen and not to Burton.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, I have found over the years that many 
unorthodox therapists repeatedly claim Dr. Kelley’s long-term patients 
as their own; misrepresentation obviously does not help cancer patients.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Sonia Nemethy is a 53-year old woman alive more than 17 years since diagnosed with breast carcinoma.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Nemethy first noticed a painless mass in her 
right breast in 1970. After biopsy studies confirmed infiltrating 
carcinoma, she went to surgery for a right radical mastectomy at St. 
Anthony’s hospital in Florida.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Nemethy was belied, cured, and received no 
further treatment at that time. In 1973, after a second tumor developed 
in the left breast, Mrs. Namethy returned to St. Anthony’s and underwent
 a left radical mastectomy for what proved to be infiltrating carcinoma.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Nemethy was again assumed to be cured, but over 
the following year, her health gradually deteriorated. She suffered 
fatigue, lethargy and bouts of depression persisting for months at a 
time.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In mid-1974, Mrs. Nemethy also developed pain along the length of the vertebral column and into the right shoulder.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By late 1974, the pain was so severe at times she was
 unable to dress or walk. Although Mrs. Nemethy consulted her physicians
 repeatedly, an evaluation was not pursued. Finally, in May of 1975, at 
Mrs. Nemethy’s insistence, her doctor arranged for a series of spinal 
X-rays.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">These studies revealed an obvious abnormality in the 
fifth lumbar segment, described as "indicative of osteolytic metastasis 
disease."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On May 28, 1975, Mrs. Nemethy returned to surgery for
 a bilateral oophorectomy (removal of both ovaries), a procedure doctors
 hoped would slow the growth of the tumor and ease her bone pain. 
Despite the surgery, Mrs. Nemethy was told she probably would not live 
out the year.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In desperation, after leaving the hospital on May 31, Mrs. Nemethy decided to investigate alternative cancer therapies.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">She quickly learned of Kelley, consulted with him and began the Kelley program in the summer of 1975.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Within six months, the persistent pain and depression
 completely resolved. Furthermore, a bone scan performed at the end 1975
 showed some improvement, and a third bone scan from mid-1976, was 
completely normal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Today, 12 years after her last episode with cancer, Mrs. Nemethy still follows the Kelley program and is in excellent condition.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As discussed previously, the five-year survival rate 
(at that time) for patients with metastatic breast cancer approaches 0% 
regardless of therapy. And oophorectomy, which may lead to symptomatic 
improvement in this group, is not curative. As Hellman writes, "In 
patients whose tumors are estrogen dependent the procedure can be 
expected to induce a regression lasting 9 months to 12 months. In 
unselected series (of patients) almost 30% to 40% of patients will 
respond. Prophylactic castration (ovary removal) following mastectomy 
does not decrease the potential relapse rate or prolong the survival of 
those who relapse."(1)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In Summary, this patient developed evidence of 
metastases after successive mastectomies for recurring breast carcinoma.
 Although she did undergo oophorectomy, Mrs. Nemethy continued to 
deteriorate after the procedure. Her extensive disease and many symptoms
 resolved only after she began the Kelley program.</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Before her bout with cancer, Mrs. Wojt had a long 
history of general poor health and chronic digestive problems. In 1974, 
she first experienced episodes of severe abdominal pain that usually 
occurred between meals, and were relieved by eating. Over the following 
three years, her symptoms gradually worsened, although she was not 
normally evaluated until spring of 1977. At that time, a barium swallow 
revealed a tumor, described in an official report as "suspicious lesion 
in the fundus and cardiac of the stomach."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Wojt was referred to a gastroenterologist, who 
biopsied the suspect tissue during endoscopy (examination of the stomach
 with a flexible tube inserted down the esophagus). After review, the 
specimen was identified as a carcinoma.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Wojt was admitted to Patterson General Hospital 
on April 17, the following day, she went to surgery (for a radical 
subtotal gastrectomy, which is resection of most of the stomach). The 
tumor had already metastasized into the surrounding tissues and lymph 
nodes; the final pathology report describes: "Adenocarcinoma of the 
stomach with metastases to the gastrocolic nodes and omentum."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Wojt was told she most likely would not live a 
year. Nevertheless, after leaving Patterson hospital in late April, she 
was referred to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York 
for possible experimental treatment. But Mrs. Wojt, who already knew of 
Dr. Kelley’s work, decided to refuse all orthodox therapy. Instead, that
 same month she consulted Dr. Kelley and began the full Kelley program. 
Mrs. Wojt followed her nutritional regimen for five years. At present, 
ten years after her diagnosis, she is in excellent health apparently 
cured of her once metastatic disease. According to Mrs. Wojt, her 
doctors are "dumbfounded" by her prolonged survival.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Wojt is indeed a remarkable case. The five-year 
survival rate for patients with metastatic stomach cancer is close to 
zero — even with aggressive therapy. Mrs. Wojt received neither 
chemotherapy nor radiation after her surgery, and chose to follow only 
the Kelley program.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">At age 61, this lawyer, blessed with a 
lovely wife and eight children, was diagnosed at Ochsner Clinic, New 
Orleans, as having acute myelogenous leukemia. My friends at Ochsner 
Clinic opined that the condition was terminal and that I had at best a 
few months and at worst a few days to live.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Following three courses of Cytosar and Thiogunine at 
the Clinic (from October 7, 1977 through about mid-December 1977), I 
fortunately had a remission. I was to continue with maintenance therapy,
 which the medics told me would, at best, improve the quality of life. 
There was slim, if any hope for recovery.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley’s book miraculously came to my wife’s 
attention. We visited him in Washington in December 1977. We were 
enthusiastic and got on the program and experienced dramatic 
improvement. The idea that you treat the body, or host, and not the 
symptoms was so intellectually stimulating and sensible, I wondered why 
my medical friends and my doctor son could not understand and why they 
discouraged and belittled my efforts. I very shortly resumed my 
practice, golf and a normal but different lifestyle.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">About midsummer of 1978, it became apparent that to 
continue the chemotherapy would destroy any hope I had of bodybuilding. 
These shots would nauseate and disrupt me and would knock my blood count
 from near normal to complete disarray. My mind indicated that they be 
discontinued, despite advice to the contrary.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I have continued with Metabolic Medicine and on the 
complete lifestyle change that holistic medicine demands for optimum 
health. I have no problems with leukemia since the initial remission was
 obtained.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I know that when I took the chemo maintenance, my 
body was disrupted. I know that when it was discontinued, I continued to
 improve without the disruption of the blood picture and the nausea.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Metabolic Medicine is so sensible, it is hard to see 
why anyone could dispute that it has a place in the lives of the acutely
 ill. Nothing is perfect and nothing makes one eternal, but in my case, I
 am thankful for the opportunity for the benefits of this non-toxic 
therapy and the miracle it brought for me.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Some call my luck "spontaneous remission," maybe so, I
 believe that Metabolic Medicine makes for "spontaneous remissions" from
 the symptoms of terminal illness in those whose bodies have not been 
abused beyond repair, whether by neglect or over treatment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Some call letters such as this "testimonials" instead
 of "case histories." For me, this is a very brief history of my case 
for whatever value and hope it may give to others.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One last observation ought to be made. Some decry 
holistic therapy that of "Hucksters" and "Quacks." Most practitioners of
 this art (and there are many medical men in this kind of practice) are 
those who have had a terminal diagnosis for themselves or loved ones and
 were disenchanted by the hopelessness and horror of traditional 
therapies. I have met many of the "Greats." None that I know drive 
Mercedes automobiles. All are healers and not moneymakers. The cost of a
 year of holistic medicine for me does not exceed the cost of one week 
of treatment in any good conventional cancer hospital.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I enjoy my family, my practice and my life. I am grateful for a therapy that has, thus for, worked for me.</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley</b>: "My dear friend Tom brings 
up a lot of wonderful memories and he brings to mind the subject of soft
 tumor. Soft tumors, it should be emphasized, are an entirely different 
condition from what we normally think of as cancer. What are soft 
tumors? I classify the leukemias, lymphomas, melanomas, tumors of the 
immune system, and those of the blood system as soft tumors. It’s very 
frightening that soft tumors are becoming so prevalent in children. 
Before 1979, we find that the highest cause of death in children was 
traumatic accidents, such as falling out of a tree or running in front 
of a car. But since 1979, we find that the leading cause of death of 
children under 16 is cancer. That is sad commentary on our society. Most
 of these cancer deaths are from the soft tumors.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"Tom was a patient 62 years of age. A lot of people, 
as they get older, as their immune systems malfunction, as their 
energies wane, as they become exhausted, develop soft tumors. Tom was a 
professional person who had a hard, active life and developed leukemia. 
It was very, very severe. In fact, so bad that he had started collecting
 fluid in the abdomen, a condition that is always fatal. It was quite 
rewarding to have a person with this condition so willing to give 100% 
attention and effort to following Metabolic Medicine in such a severe, 
advanced disease. It is always a joy to me to see a patient so 
conscientious and pure of heart in following the program. In Tom’s case 
we find that the side effects of the program — such side effects as 
resuming his law practice and feeling terrific — were quite astounding 
also."</p>

</font><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY">9-Year Victory Over Breast Cancer</p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">In January of 1973, I had another checkup 
from my breast doctor in Beverly Hills (a breast surgeon, tops in this 
field). I had been going to him every six months for two years, then 
every four months for one year, then every two months until January of 
1973, at which time he told me the lump in my left breast had gotten 
very large and I would have to go to surgery. His nurse told me he was 
an expert and that he could tell by feeling the lump if it was malignant
 or benign and that a mammogram gave a 96% account of the tumor whether 
it was malignant or benign. The doctor explained how nicely he would 
remove the breast, etc., and about bras for women whose breasts have 
been removed. He also was going to Europe for two months; my surgery 
would be scheduled when he returned.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I had read Dr. Kelley’s book some months before and I
 decided to go to one of our local health food stores where I had bought
 the book to talk to the owner, who was always well informed on natural 
foods and vitamins. She told me to call some people in town who had gone
 to Dr. Kelley and that I should by all means go to him. I was very 
encouraged when I talked to the people who had gone to Dr. Kelley. All 
had cancer at one time, and one person in particular was most helpful to
 me.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was just starting a new job at this time as a 
singer in a famous Italian restaurant singing opera and musical comedy. 
This was several times around for me to "start" my career again after 
having three children and being a housewife for a few years. I was very 
excited but was not feeling good.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I flew to see Dr. Kelley, then in Texas, and my 
cancer count was 600. I took Dr. Kelley’s advice, went home and started 
on his program of diet, enemas and supplements. I was weak at first but 
in a few months I really started feeling so much better. My husband was 
totally against the program, my friends at church thought I was crazy 
and I found it was difficult to pay for all the supplements, but I was 
determined to stay on the entire program.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I kept my appointment with the breast surgeon but had
 been on Dr. Kelley’s program for two months when I returned for my 
examination. I was told the lump had gone down and no surgery was 
needed. I left his office in early March of 1973 and have not been back 
since. The following year I was not only singing four nights per week 
but was working at a very busy TV station eight hours per day.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I continued to see Dr. Kelley once a year and my 
cancer count continued to decrease until my last checkup in August of 
1977 when my cancer count was 60, which Dr. Kelley says is normal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I couldn’t say enough about how I would never take 
any other treatment for cancer than Dr. Kelley’s. In fact, I consult him
 on all my physical problems, I wouldn’t think of taking another 
doctor’s advice without asking Dr. Kelley’s first. I tell everyone about
 Dr. Kelley!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I am a most happy and satisfied patient of Dr. Kelley!</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley:</b> "Many people want me to 
make decisions for them: Should I have chemotherapy? Should I do this? 
Should I do that? Should I do what the doctor tells me to do, or not to 
do what he tells me to do? These kinds of questions have given me many, 
many hours of frustration and anxiety. First of all, I am in a legal 
position where I cannot tell the patient not to do what the doctor tells
 them to do. And I know the physician does the very best he knows how. 
It is just that he is suffering from a great deal of ignorance. So, 
legally I am in a very bad situation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"Morally, I am even in a worse position. It becomes 
quite a dilemma in my mind. All of us would like to take the easy way 
out and have somebody make our decisions for us. But that doesn’t give 
us the education we need and the experiences that are our responsibility
 to take on.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"So, the way I address the problem is this: God has 
given us a rulebook to follow for our education. He tells us these are 
the principles we should follow in our life’s activities; and if we do 
these things, this will happen; and if we do those things, that will 
happen. And then he lets us have the total freedom and free will to do 
what we will, and live with the consequences. I study and try to find 
the basic principles.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"In a similar sense, Metabolic Medicine is 
essentially a program based upon what I have observed in thousands of 
cases to be sound principles. I am continually improving my 
understanding of these principles and all I can do is educate the 
patient to the best of my ability. I look at each patient and say, 
‘These are the things that I’ve observed, and these are the principles 
upon which our program exists.’</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"If you have a life threatening situation, such as a 
tumor mass blocking the colon or blocking the bladder or blocking the 
stomach or blocking the air passage, you should, of course, address it 
in such a way as to take care of it. Orthodox medicine has done a very 
excellent job of addressing life-threatening situations such as trauma, 
and infections. Each individual patient has to make the decision in a 
life-threatening situation. If you have a 5-lb. tumor in the abdomen and
 it is dead from your doing a nutritional program, it’s certainly going 
to be easier to remove this 5-lb. tumor and throw it away than it would 
be to sit there and have your immune system and body chemistry gradually
 dissolve it, using a lot of energy and stressing the body to dissolve 
it into the bloodstream and then cleaning out the bloodstream through 
the liver and the other organs of elimination.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"In any situation that is addressed, you have to hold
 to basic principles and do some ecological thinking. It would be stupid
 to say you are going to follow a nutritional program when a tumor is 
blocking the intestinal tract and you can’t get any food into your body 
and you can’t get any nutritional support. It would likewise be stupid 
to say, "I am going to take chemotherapy because I have a snarled tumor 
in my colon and I’ll take chemotherapy to the point of death and then 
have a better chance of survival." Every situation is addressed 
individually, with understanding, knowledge and wisdom."</p>

</font><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY">6-Year Victory Over Breast and Liver Cancer</p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">At the time of writing this testimonial, 
Rosswitha had a 4-year victory over breast and liver cancer. Nutritional
 Counseling Service heard from her in 1983 and she was in excellent 
health and enthusiastic about the program.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In June 1976, I discovered a lump on my left breast. 
My gynecologist sent me to have a mammography done. The result was 
positive and he told me it was almost certainly a malignant growth. I 
went to a surgeon who examined me thoroughly and had some more X-rays 
done. He found I had an enlarged liver and said he would have to do an 
exploratory operation before doing a mastectomy. After the operation, he
 told me I had cancer on the liver too and that there was no point in 
removing the breast. He said he would give me two sessions of 
chemotherapy. I decided (after two weeks of pills and injections) to go 
to the University Clinic Hospital in Frankfurt, Germany, where my 
parents live. The surgeon in Malaga, Spain, gave me a report to take to 
Germany, which said I had cancer of the breast with a massive growth on 
the liver and another in the abdominal area.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I had more examinations and a scan test in Frankfurt,
 and the surgeon there confirmed the Spanish report and said the growth 
of the tumor was fist-size. He told my husband and myself there was no 
cure and the most we could hope for was a remission. He would not say 
how long a remission. He advised me to have a mastectomy to remove the 
primary growth in the breast and to have the ovaries taken out to change
 the hormone balance in the body, which would make the subsequent 
chemotherapy treatment more effective.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We were given the impression that there was no time 
to lose and little alternative. I decided to have the surgery and 
chemotherapy in the hope that it would give me a remission and enough 
time to seek a cure elsewhere. By this time I was feeling bad. I was 
suffering, I think, from the reactions of the chemotherapy in Spain. I 
had an infection in the bladder, which was painful. My hair was 
beginning to fall out. I felt weak and depressed. When I returned to the
 hospital a few days later for the operation, I could hardly walk. I was
 operated on July 28 and started chemotherapy (injections) on September 
1.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I stayed in the hospital only three days after each 
chemotherapy treatment, and, after the third session, the doctors began 
to comment on this, comparing me with the other patients, who were on 
their backs for days after the treatments. I suggested it could be due 
to the diet I was on. The moment I learned I had cancer I had put myself
 on a healthy diet, cut all the chemicalized foods, and made adjustments
 to it when a friend in Germany gave a book on food for cancer patients.
 The doctors and nurses seemed amused at this and said I could eat 
anything I wanted — it would make no difference. I continued with my 
diet.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There was a woman doctor in the chemotherapy ward who
 seemed more willing than the others to discuss my problem with me and I
 told her of my intention to seek a cure and showed her a booklet on Dr.
 Nieper of Hanover. She had not heard of Dr. Nieper or his treatment and
 told me I was responding well to the chemotherapy and should forget 
about any other kind of treatment until I had completed the chemotherapy
 sessions. I couldn’t forget about it, though, as I was becoming more 
convinced that chemotherapy was not going to give me the long remission I
 had hoped for and that I had better look quickly for an alternative 
treatment.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When I was told I had cancer, my husband and myself 
did the contrary to what many people do in this situation; we told 
everyone we knew about my problem, hoping somebody could point us to a 
cure. My husband, publishing the English-language magazine on the Costa 
de Sol (an international retirement center full of informed people from 
all over the world), is in a good position to find out about things, 
and, even before I began chemotherapy in Frankfurt, we had gathered a 
lot of information and were writing to a dozen doctors and clinics 
around Europe who were using unorthodox treatments to cure cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A friend gave us a copy of the Healthview Newsletter 
at this time, and the long interview with Dr. Kelley in which he 
explained very clearly his theory and treatment, gave me tremendous 
hope. Here was proof that cancer was being cured.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was given a break in the chemotherapy treatment and
 returned to our home in Spain towards the end of November 1976. The 
chemotherapy was taking its toll and I felt I was going downhill. I was 
bald, often depressed, very weak and in pain. Until then, even during 
the worst moments, I believed I would somehow fight my way back to good 
health. When I read somewhere that only one in ten thousand survived 
chemotherapy, I assumed I was going to be the one in ten thousand. Now I
 wasn’t so sure, and was so weak I felt I’d had enough and couldn’t go 
on. The cramps in my stomach became unbearable and we called in a local 
doctor, a friend of ours, and he gave me an injection to kill the pains.
 He called my husband aside and told him that he had given me morphine 
and would come immediately any hour of the day or night to give me more 
as I needed it. He thought I couldn’t live many more days. Another 
doctor friend, who runs a local clinic where I was having regular blood 
checks, had received a report from the Frankfurt hospital, which stated I
 had a fist-sized growth on the liver and several other plum-size 
growths in the pelvis area. Questioned by my husband as to my chances, 
he simply shook his head and said, "malo, malo, malo" (bad, bad, bad).</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I felt the stomach cramps were indigestion and became
 extremely careful about what I ate. In fact, at this point I was almost
 too frightened to eat anything. I knew now I had to do something 
quickly before it was too late. We began studying all the information we
 had gathered on cancer cures and set ourselves a time limit of two days
 to make our decision. This was perhaps the most agonizing time of all. I
 felt we had to make the right choice the first time, as there wouldn’t 
be time for another. My Yoga teacher joined us (I had started Yoga some 
weeks before and each day was doing some simple exercises, mainly 
breathing exercises, which I believed would strengthen me and help me 
relax). We had several books on cancer treatments but kept coming back 
to Dr. Kelley’s <b><i>One Answer to Cancer.</i></b> It made sense to me 
and I was particularly impressed by the fact that Dr. Kelley had gone 
through what I was going through and had cured himself. I had felt 
convinced about Dr. Kelley for weeks but I was put off by the distance I
 would have to travel to see him. He seemed so far away and I dreaded 
the journey. I made my decision at the end of two days and phoned The 
Kelley Foundation in Winthrop, Washington. As much as my husband wanted 
to go with me, we agreed that it would be more practical if he stayed at
 home with our three small children (ages 5, 7, and 9) and I be 
accompanied on the journey by my yoga teacher, who — being American — 
would probably prove more useful during our time in the States.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Winthrop was quite a contrast to the hospital in 
Frankfurt. I had been very impressed at first by the vast buildings, the
 army of doctors and nurses, the apparent efficiency of the Frankfurt 
hospital and felt, mistakenly, I had come to the right place and that 
here they must be clever enough to cure anything. Arriving in Winthrop, I
 wondered if it could be possible that such important work as Dr. 
Kelley’s was being carried out in such a tiny place miles and miles from
 anywhere.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley himself was quite different from the 
doctors in Frankfurt who had made me feel I was being a nuisance every 
time I asked a question about my condition and treatment. This attitude I
 had found frustrating, as it was my life in their hands and I 
considered I had a right to know exactly what they were doing with it. 
The other patients didn’t seem to mind being treated like children who 
should keep quiet and do as they were told. At least, I never heard any 
ask questions about the treatment they were receiving or drugs they were
 being given. When I suggested to a fellow patient receiving 
chemotherapy and in constant pain that she eat something healthier than 
Frankfurter sausages and ice cream, she said the doctors knew best and 
they would surely not give her food that was not good for her.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At last I was speaking with a doctor who treated me 
like an intelligent human being and was quite willing to discuss all the
 details of my illness. Dr. Kelley explained everything very clearly, 
admitted I was in a bad state but said he saw no reason why I shouldn’t 
come through if I followed the treatment. It was largely up to me. I 
felt tremendous relief and hope. It was like the chance to live had been
 taken away and was now being given back to me. I now had a chance and 
it was all I asked for. If my recovery depended largely on my own 
efforts, I felt confident I would succeed, as I was ready to do anything
 to get well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Returning home, I stopped off at Frankfurt where I 
had a mid-December appointment for more chemotherapy. I hated the idea 
of having more drugs pumped into me but relatives and friends at 
Frankfurt, nervous at the thought of my dropping the orthodox treatment,
 advised me to keep the appointment, and Dr. Kelley did not seem opposed
 to the idea of my having one more session. I went to the hospital but 
the moment they started giving me the injections I felt I had made a 
terrible mistake and that all the drugs were going to do was poison my 
body and weaken it even more.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I felt terrible afterwards. I was in bed for several 
days with pains, nausea and exhaustion, and I felt very depressed. I 
felt so weak I couldn’t face the journey home to spend Christmas with my
 husband and my children. I spent all Christmas day vowing I would take 
no more drugs. All I wanted now was to go home and start Dr. Kelley’s 
program. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I began the nutritional program on January 3, 1977. 
Swallowing all the supplements and taking the morning enema was a bit of
 an effort at first but after a few days I got used to this and it 
became routine. I suffered none of the reactions Dr. Kelley warned me 
about. In fact, I began to feel better almost immediately. The pains 
went and, except for an ache in the shoulder during a bout of flu last 
winter, I have had none since I started the program.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I followed Dr. Kelley’s advice and became selfish for
 a few months, concentrating all my thought and efforts on my own health
 and helping my body to become strong again. I continued my daily yoga 
exercises. I started a vegetable garden so we could have fresh 
vegetables. I began to make my own bread, made from whole-grain flour we
 bought from an old mill in an inland Pueblo. I felt now I was doing 
something positive and, after months of pain and depression, was now on 
the road to recovery.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After eight months, I was re-tested and Dr. Kelley 
wrote me to tell me I was making very good progress. This was 
tremendously encouraging but I already knew in myself that I was getting
 stronger with each week that passed. Around this time, I went to see 
the surgeon in Malaga who had examined me the previous year. He examined
 me and was amazed that he could no longer feel the growth on the liver.
 He said he thought it had gone. I wondered whether he was trying to 
cheer me up but we later learned through a mutual doctor friend that he 
discussed my case during a medical reunion in Malaga and said I was 
taking some weird treatment in America and, whatever it was, it seemed 
to be working.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We have several doctor friends here in Spain who are 
familiar with my case. Whenever I see them, they seem very pleased to 
see how well I am looking but show no curiosity nor do they express the 
slightest interest in the treatment I am on. This puzzles me as I should
 have thought a doctor, more than any other person, would want to know 
how I am recovering from an illness they regard as incurable and which, 
according to them, should have killed me more than a year before.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After a year of staying most of the time at home and 
concentrating quietly on the business of getting well and following my 
nutritional program to the letter, I began, little by little, to go out 
and become more active. I consider I am now leading a normal life. I run
 a home, am involved in the PTA at my children’s Spanish school, and 
help my husband in the office three times a week.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I might still have some cancer in my body but this 
does not worry me. I am convinced it is only a matter of months before I
 am completely cured. Dr. Kelley told me that my illness could turn out 
to be a blessing in disguise. I could not believe this at the time but 
now I am sure he was right. I feel I am starting a new life. My family 
is now eating a healthier diet. And I feel my illness has brought my 
husband and myself closer together. I also have the added satisfaction 
of being able to help other people. Quite a number have heard about my 
recovery and have come to me for information and advice.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Some people I have spoken to have been impressed by 
the nutritional program but have been unable to believe that the doctors
 who have put them on chemotherapy could be wrong. Most of them have 
since died and this saddens me because I feel their deaths were 
unnecessary. I only wish I had heard about Dr. Kelley earlier and had 
not submitted myself to surgery and chemotherapy. But this, perhaps, is 
negative thinking. I feel very grateful that I have been given the 
chance to get well. I feel lucky to be alive.</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley:</b> "Rosswitha brought to my 
attention one of the things I just take for granted and should be a 
characteristic of all doctors — people who are really doctors. She said,
 ‘At last I was speaking with a doctor who treated me like an 
intelligent human being and was quite willing to discuss all the details
 of my illness.’ That seems to me to be the way it should be, but I have
 to confess at this point that I am the one who benefits — a thousand 
times more than the patient does. Every single patient I have had the 
privilege of working with and talking to taught me more than I could 
ever teach them. Patients have given to me more than I could ever give 
to them. The lessons that I’ve learned working with each one of them 
have been such a beautiful experience that I just can’t go on and leave 
it unmentioned here.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"I find it really sad if the clinician can’t learn 
from each patient. I can’t comprehend the clinician having this 
phenomenal educational institution right in front of him and not 
learning a great deal. Not only did I learn a lot, but the people paid 
me to learn and I always felt a little guilty about that. I learned so 
much that it looked to me that I ought to be paying them. But I wouldn’t
 have been able to function if they hadn’t been paying me to be learning
 to do a better job each day. I certainly appreciated it and I hope it 
has been a feeling of mutual gain on both of our parts.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"Rosswitha brings to mind a comparison of cancer with
 diabetes. Before Dr. Banting and Best discovered insulin in 1918 in 
Canada, a person would have diabetes and would ask the doctor if it 
could be anything he was eating, and should he change his diet in any 
way? And the doctor would say, ‘Oh no, it doesn’t make any difference — 
eat anything you want, you aren’t going to live much longer anyhow, so 
just live it up and eat whatever you want.’ Doctors couldn’t connect the
 diet and diabetes. Even lay people in those days figured out that if 
you ate a lot of leafy green vegetables and reduced the amount of sugar 
that you took in, you survived better and did well — better than the 
person who didn’t watch his diet.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"And so it was that after the development of insulin,
 doctors figured out that there is a factor in diet. In the early 1920s 
there weren’t very good analytical facilities available. But the doctors
 empirically found that the people who ate green leafy vegetables, and a
 few other foods, survived diabetes much better and the sugar count in 
their urine was much better. They had a saying in the medical community 
at that time that leafy, green vegetables had ‘natural insulin’ in them.
 It wasn’t actually the truth, but they became aware of the fact that 
including these vegetables in the diet did play a role and they were 
trying to explain it. We’re in the same situation now with cancer. Some 
day in the near future, it will dawn on the medical community that diet 
makes quite a difference in people with cancer, and greatly affects 
health in general. It can’t happen too soon. When it does, a lot of 
lives will be lived more healthfully and a lot of lives will be saved."</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">I am a farmer’s wife, age 53. We live in a
 modern, ranch-style home in Northeast Iowa. We raise cattle and have 
about 500 acres in diversified farming. We have always been active in 
church, farm bureau, school, and community affairs. We have four married
 children.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I have worked outdoors doing fieldwork, chores, 
chickens to tend, and a large vegetable and fruit garden. My children 
had lots of sickness from tonsillitis to chronic bronchitis, and 
coughing day and night with high fevers. When we learned about 
chiropractic, that helped us a lot. When our youngest daughter was 14, 
she missed six weeks of school with headaches as a forerunner of 
arthritis. She was in three different hospitals, with all the typical 
medical tests done, showing nothing but arthritis. They sent us home 
with the comment that there was nothing they could do for her arthritis 
but give her 6 to 20 aspirin a day. From here, I studied nutrition like 
mad and would give her various things for her condition and she improved
 dramatically. The next year, she needed a health examination so she 
could be a lifeguard and the doctor told us he had never seen anyone so 
healthy. I told him it was all the nutrition I was giving her and he 
said that had nothing to do with it, but I knew it was the answer. We 
have had numerous medical doctors but none knew anything about nutrition
 or will admit it has anything to do with health.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I spent nine years working with the American Cancer 
Society as door knocker, county chairman, crusade chairman, at district 
meetings and state conventions. My mother died of cancer. I know what 
the word "cancer" means — the hopeless feeling, the despair — and I am 
scared to death of it. When I made my last call on a dear friend who 
died of cancer, I wanted to say to her: "I’ll be the next one," for I 
had found a lump in my breast at that time; also, I was having digestive
 disturbances. This was three years after I started learning about 
nutrition. I have read a lot of books, health magazines, etc. I knew 
what medical science was doing. I was determined I would not go to be 
butchered at the hospital. I said nothing to anyone about the lump. It 
got larger as time went on. I was trying to eat right, as much as I 
could read in the books.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The following March, my husband wanted to get each of
 us a life insurance policy. I said nothing but I knew I wouldn’t pass a
 health test. The doctor told my husband about the lump and I was 
refused the insurance policy. He told me to go to the hospital and have a
 biopsy, etc. I wouldn’t go. We went to visit my sister and told her. By
 this time the lump was plainly visible when you looked at my breast. In
 a few days she telephoned she had learned of a chiropractor that could 
help. He had helped his daughter. A light in the tunnel. We started 
going to the chiropractor three times a week, a 100-mile trip. After a 
few calls, he told us about Dr. Kelley and advised both my sister and me
 to go to him, as she had had surgery and they found cancer. In June we 
made our first call to Dr. Kelley. By this time the lump in my breast 
was 1-3/4 inches across and there were numerous small ones and even some
 in the other breast and more digestive disturbances.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Looking back now, I can see the Lord leading me to 
study about nutrition so I would be prepared to know what I needed when 
Dr. Kelley set up our nutritional plan. I told our children of the lump 
in my breast and our plans to go to Texas to see Dr. Kelley. From the 
beginning, I had the assurance that I was doing the right thing. I had 
accepted Christ as my Saviour and I knew His perfect peace and was 
assured of His leading. Our youngest daughter made it plain she thought I
 should go to a medical doctor. My husband was doubtful, but let me do 
what I wanted to do.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I ordered Dr. Kelley’s book, <b><i>One Answer to Cancer</i></b>
 and started the beginning of the treatment. This looked like a large 
undertaking. Dr. Kelley was a long way off and would be hard to contact 
regarding problems from day to day. Still I never doubted that this was 
the way I should go. I have doctored my children for 18 years with 
medical doctors and medicines and never had any help. This had to be the
 better way. I never told my family doctor about the lump in my breast. 
The only one who knew of it was the doctor who had refused me the 
insurance policy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When we went to Dr. Kelley for our test, he counseled
 us as long as we had questions. We left his office with our programs to
 follow. My sister and I studied our books all the way home, which was a
 three-day trip. Dr. Kelley had told us in his book what to expect, how 
we would feel and what our body reactions would be, so we would be 
prepared to know what was happening. Whenever we had doubts, we kept 
remembering that Dr. Kelley had this and he knows what to do. This was 
our confidence.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I bought a juicer and made carrot and celery juice 
several times a day. That took a lot of time. Preparing all of the fresh
 vegetables takes time. But, I had my own garden for years so I knew how
 much work it is to raise and prepare vegetables for the table. Now we 
were eating everything raw possible. Even my family cooperated.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Within two weeks, my digestive disturbances were 
better. At first I’d go out and work awhile and come in to fix carrot 
juice and lay down to rest. Then get up and go out again to finish the 
jobs. My family helped carry the water and feed for the chickens, but I 
still raised and dressed 150 chickens that first summer. In six weeks, I
 felt really good. I didn’t have any of the things that Dr. Kelley had 
written in the book that I might have. My body responded quickly and I 
began to regain my strength that I hadn’t had for months. <b>I Never Ate One Thing</b>
 I was not supposed to eat. I took my nutrition exactly as he told me. I
 have always been a determined person. I did everything as near right as
 I could or knew to do. This helped me in my diet. If I had even once 
eaten sweets or anything that was on the list of "no-no’s," I wouldn’t 
have been able to win the game. That’s what you need — determination to 
follow the rules.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In six months the lumps in my breasts were gone. I 
felt much better than I had before. I had not had surgery and the awful 
ordeal of that, or intravenous feeding, and I still had a whole body. I 
was telling everyone to eat right. But I did not tell anyone (outside of
 my family) that I had cancer. People knew I had been really sick, but 
not what was really wrong with me. I guess I wanted to be sure myself 
that I could do it before I would tell anyone you could lick cancer with
 proper lifestyle and nutrition. I continued chiropractic treatment for 
years, and still do. Mostly when I talk to people about eating properly —
 not eating food with preservatives, eating raw foods instead of cooked 
ones — they make light of it and never really listen. Yet, many call me 
with all of their ills and ask me what they should do. Some I can advise
 and some don’t believe what you say anyway.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Three years later in March, I applied for another 
insurance policy with another company. I told him I had been refused a 
policy because of the lumps in my breast. He sent me for another health 
examination with another doctor. I told this doctor also about the lumps
 — that I did not go to a doctor but I started taking nutrition and 
eating raw foods, etc. and the lumps went away. He couldn’t find any 
lumps. They X-rayed my chest and found nothing. Yet he would not believe
 the nutrition had anything to do with it. He told me I was in excellent
 health and I got the insurance policy. It was a much larger policy than
 the one I had been refused because of the lumps in my breast.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In July after the X-rays, I noticed the lumps in my 
breast again. I had just read an article in the paper that they were 
finding "hard evidence that X-rays are actually causing cancer." On July
 20, 1976, when I discovered the lumps back again, I immediately went 
back on my original schedule and diet and within 6 months my lumps were 
gone again. My advice to others would be — don’t get X-rays taken. The 
radiation exposure is too dangerous.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After 5 years with Dr. Kelley, I do not need tests as
 often as I did. I follow his diet list and my own home grown foods when
 possible. I continue to take all kinds of nutrition as he recommends. I
 am not as strict with my diet as I was the first three years but when I
 don’t eat right, or stop the nutrition, I don’t feel good and I know 
what to do to get better again. Dr. Kelley has answered personally all 
my letters to him about health problems that come up. He takes my 
telephone calls when I need to know something right away. Good health is
 something you need to work at daily. Dr. Kelley’s advice works. My 
illness has given my husband and me a better, closer relationship than 
we have ever known. I know Metabolic Medicine works. It did for me.</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley:</b> "It’s hard to appreciate 
the sorts of obstacles patients had to overcome to see me as a 
clinician. First of all, I am not a medical doctor I am a dentist. 
Second, my office was unbelievably unacceptable when compared to where a
 lot of these people had gone — to the great clinics and hospitals of 
our world. They really had to lower themselves to come into my meager 
surroundings. While adequately appointed and kept immaculately clean by 
my receptionist, there certainly was no pretension in any respect. On 
many occasions, people would drive up in their Cadillac or Rolls Royce 
and drive away because they thought that they couldn’t possibly find 
anything of worth in such an unpretentious office."</p>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The parents of the patient relate this testimony.</p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Female: age 27, no history of smoking, drinking or drugs; attack of hypoglycemia between ages of 15-17.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">November 1973 (when D was 20) was our fist indication
 of a problem. D was stricken with aches and pains and fever. A 3-day 
flu had been hitting our area with similar symptoms so at this point we 
were not overly concerned. After several days of unsuccessfully trying 
to keep her temperature down, we decided this was something other than 
the flu. At the emergency receiving room of our hospital, chest X-rays, 
blood tests and urinalysis failed to locate her problem. Her temperature
 range for a 24-hour period went from below normal to 106ºF. We were 
referred to a M.D. who specialized in internal medicine.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus began a nightmare that lasted many weeks. 
Testing for one week as an outpatient ended in no answers. She was 
rapidly going downhill — weakened by the many hospital trips. We were 
advised to admit her into the hospital for extensive testing. Up to this
 point in our lives we had never even considered the fact that anyone 
could be this sick and not have a physician give the reason. We feared 
in the beginning a serious disease, but as time went on we would have 
welcomed anything that would have been a concrete answer. Watching D 
dying with no apparent reason left us quite helpless except for our 
faith in God. As time went on we found ourselves doing more praying and 
less reaching out to Man for answers. We needed a miracle and we had no 
doubt where that would come from.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Biopsies, scans, X-rays, bone marrow tests and blood 
taken every two hours became our way of life for the next ten days. No 
answers. D losing ground. Six local doctors and two consulting doctors 
from a larger city failed to find anything that could be causing death.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By now D had lost 40 pounds, most of her hair had 
fallen out, her menstrual periods had stopped, severe anemia and painful
 hot lumps traveled all over her body. Massive doses of penicillin and 
streptomycin had caused a near total hearing loss. She was dying from 
malnutrition.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The week before Christmas the doctor informed us that
 D had run out of time. The only thing left was exploratory surgery. 
After questioning the doctor closely about her chances of coming through
 the surgery and of their chances in finding the problem, we decided to 
take her home. It was a big decision. If she was going to die, we wanted
 her to be at home where her loved ones could be with her. No more tests
 and definitely no hospital, we were leaving for home with a lung fungus
 medication although all tests were negative.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Little did we know that this would be the turning 
point in our battle. Everything was downhill from there out except for 
one minor incident.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We were on our own now but somehow had a strange 
feeling of relief. We had no intention of just sitting and waiting; we 
could not just do nothing. We began with Adelle Davis’ anti-stress 
formula and large does of vitamin C — (the doctor had refused to give D 
any vitamin C through the vein while in the hospital.) We had been 
taking natural vitamins for several years and knew vitamin C would do no
 harm. As we look back we know that this was God’s way of letting us 
know we were finally on the right track. Many people all over the USA 
were praying which resulted in two tired weary people getting divine 
guidance directly from God daily.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Five days after the vitamin C was given, her temperature was normal. God in simplicity, restored life to a dying body.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our first visit to the doctor’s office three weeks 
later found D improved in every area, strong enough to walk, hair 
growing, appetite normal and gaining weight. The doctor’s face could not
 hide his disbelief. His associates came for a look-see too. After we 
explained what we had done, he checked her records and gave all the 
credit to the fungus medication. He was so sure and convincing, we made 
our first blunder since leaving their hospital. We cut back on the 
vitamin C and concentrated on the medication. Her temperature rose 
immediately. We were shook. After asking God’s forgiveness, we resumed 
with our vitamin C schedule, adding health-building foods as fast as D 
could take them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A searching time began as we looked for answers. D 
was returning to health as rapidly as she went down, but what happened? 
Would it happen again? Did God want us to go on searching for the answer
 or accept her healing and let it go at that. God led our steps to the 
answer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Because we were involved in a natural business, we 
had heard of Dr. Kelley. Thinking he could help us with a proper 
balanced diet that would be scientific instead of guesswork, we began to
 investigate the possibility of a visit. We had exhausted our finances 
paying hospital and doctor fees, so back to earnest praying. When we 
received a check from a friend in the amount that we needed for the 
trip, we knew God had given us a green light.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In March our first visit to Dr. Kelley was made. We 
could not believe what took place. Answers instead of questions. How 
refreshing! There was a problem: A malignant tumor on her pancreas. It 
was still there. Wasn’t God good to keep us searching? (A medical doctor
 later confirmed the tumor.) Although we were saddened by the nature of 
her problem, we were relieved to finally have an answer. We were told 
when her problem started, how long it would take to clear it and a 
possible reason for the problem beginning in the first place. The diet 
alone would have been worth the trip, the rest we considered priceless.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Upon our return we began to change our lifestyle to 
fit D’s new program. It was difficult, but we followed it in its 
entirety without any alterations. D had amazingly few problems and 
returned to work June 1. (A total leave-of-absence of 6 months.) To date
 she has had no recurrence of cancer and no major health problems of any
 nature. She takes vitamin and mineral supplements.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What we have learned about cancer through Dr. Kelley 
has spared at least eight lives. We would go the same route again well 
knowing what we would be getting into and knowing the results. D’s life 
was worth it all; the other eight we look at as a major bonus from the 
Lord. My unanswered question: Why could Dr. Kelley find in one day what 
many doctors could not find in many months?</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley:</b> "Pancreatic cancer is very 
devastating and very close to my heart because that’s what I had. The 
average life expectancy of a clinically diagnosed case of pancreas 
malignancy is two months. This lovely young lady, with eight years’ 
survival, is an example of what can be done with total family unity. 
This family is a wonderful example of ‘how to.’ They addressed two 
contributing factors to successful healing — a positive attitude and the
 willingness to do whatever it takes to get well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"Pancreatic cancer has some particular 
characteristics which are not like other cancers. These characteristics 
include a lot of excessive gas and very unusual mental states such as 
very severe nightmares, depression, anxiety and all the negative factors
 that otherwise happy and cheerful individuals would not have. Such 
individuals flip into depression and irritation and become hard to get 
along with.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"D is so nice, it’s hard to imagine her being hard to
 get along with. But even if she was, her parents would have understood 
and paid no attention. That kind of unselfish support can make the 
difference between life and death."</p>

</font></b><p>"You have cancer."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When I heard those three words over the telephone my 
only thought was "I’m going to die!" I was "shook up!" I barely heard 
the voice on the other end of the telephone tell me to come in and see 
Dr. S.L. as soon as possible.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Only another cancer patient knows what it means to be
 told "you have cancer." It is not only a sentence of death; it is a 
sentence of death linked with severe pain.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was 46, living and working in New York City when I 
was diagnosed as having cancer. I had been feeling "poorly" since I was 
37 and had had a partial hysterectomy. I was trying every day to live 
with "feeling poorly" because no doctor I saw was able to help me "feel 
better." And believe me, I saw many physicians in the "Big Apple."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our family physician, Dr. H.H., said I should see a 
specialist because my periods were too long, I was losing too much blood
 during each period and I had fibroids. I went to the specialist he 
recommended who urged me not to wait, but to have the operation "before 
it was too late." I followed orders. I had the operation. (By the way, I
 remember being sedated and prepared in the morning for the operation, 
which was scheduled for 1:00 p.m. I remember not being wheeled in until 
4:00 p.m.! I was worried and wondered . . . will I get the right 
operation? This experience filled me with dismay and created distrust 
for the medical profession.)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was discharged with a clean bill of health. Now 
that I had had the operation, did I feel better? No, I felt worse! I was
 passing gas, feeling tired and terribly constipated. It did no good to 
hear nice words of assurance from the doctor or that the tumor they had 
removed was the size of a five-month pregnancy. I didn’t feel better 
hearing that it was normal for some people not to have daily bowl 
movements. I felt loggy. Shortly after the operation and an "OK checkup"
 from the surgeon, I went to our family physician with the complaint "I 
have pain in the abdomen." He examined me and was surprised to find a 
cyst in the former womb area. He asked me to return to the specialist. I
 refused. I told our family physician that my confidence in the 
specialist was gone. I asked him to take care of me. After much 
pleading, he did. He removed the cyst in his office by cauterization. 
Those were two painful office visits for me.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I still felt rotten. I was fatigued all the time and 
passing gas much of the time. I had attacks of illness diagnosed as 
myositis and facial neuritis. I had pains in my abdomen, which were 
diagnosed as a nervous stomach. The family doctor suggested I take the 
gallbladder test. I took it. Fortunately, at the time, there was nothing
 wrong with my gallbladder. I went to the dentist often because my gums 
were bleeding and my teeth were loose.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was born with a brown mole on my left cheek. When I
 was 14, hair began to grow in the mole. It didn’t hurt, but I felt a 
pulsating sensation in the mole area. I saw a doctor who recommended 
removing the hairs by electrolysis. I did this. Afterward, the doctor 
said "It looks OK; we’ll leave it alone for now, but you should always 
watch the mole for any changes."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Two years after the hysterectomy operation at the age
 of 39, the brown mole on my left check started to throb and grow. I saw
 a skin specialist and had the mole excised. A biopsy was performed. 
Diagnosis: Non-malignant.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the fall of 1969, I saw a gynecologist for a 
checkup. This doctor recommended estrogen because I had had a partial 
hysterectomy. I took the estrogen for three months only because round 
white spots emerged on both of my thighs and a growth developed under 
the arch of my left foot. I had to have this growth surgically removed. 
This, too, was biopsied and declared non-malignant. At the same time, 
the skin specialist removed some small growths on my face, forehead and 
right wrist.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was depressed; I was still suffering with passing 
gas; my eyes were deteriorating. I couldn’t focus; couldn’t see 
telephone numbers or addresses in the telephone book, found it difficult
 to read the newspapers. I suffered with muscle weakness and cramps. The
 latter condition would often strike me at night while I was sleeping 
with such severity that I would wake up screaming from the pain. My 
chestnut brown hair was turning gray; the texture was now brittle. Worst
 of all, my face "itched" 24 hours a day. I wanted to holler because 
there was no letup of pain. I found I could no longer tolerate any 
sunlight.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I went to yet another specialist. I gave him a list 
of my complaints. He gave me a battery of tests, a big bill, and said 
that the tests showed there was nothing wrong with me. He said, "You’re 
getting older, try to make things easier." He suggested I see a 
psychiatrist. I questioned him about my facial condition. He said the 
facial problem was probably part of my active imagination. Ooh, but I 
was angry when I left his office.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I found the pain in my face intolerable. I made an 
appointment with a skin specialist in 1971. He performed surgery in his 
office and said, "We’ll do a biopsy but I doubt that you’ll get your 
money’s worth," Well, his office is the party that called and told me, 
"You have cancer." I think I was shocked because I thought I had a 
charmed existence when it came to surgery and biopsies. After all, I had
 been through many operations and biopsies and all had been diagnosed as
 being benign.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I followed the skin specialist’s recommendation of 
going into the hospital immediately and having the "entire cancerous 
tumor completely removed." He said he was sure this would be the case.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The short hospital stay was an ordeal. For a facial 
condition, I had to undergo a series of body X-rays and other tests. 
When I asked, "Why? I was told it was "hospital procedure." I don’t know
 what good they did; I do know it hiked up the bill. In the hospital I 
had a section between my lip and chin cut again. This biopsy also stated
 that "the patient has cancer." The doctor said, "Go home, let your face
 heal and see me in six months."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">About this time I began to visit health food stores 
in my neighborhood. Why? I thought there might be something to taking 
supplements. I was hoping to find something to take to have more energy.
 I bought books on health and I bought health magazines. I was 
investigating another avenue towards feeling better.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I didn’t wait six months to see the doctor. I called 
for an appointment four months later because of the continuing pain. I 
saw the skin specialist and on January 14, 1972, he cut away another 
portion of my chin. Another biopsy was performed. Diagnosis: Cancer. He 
now told me that I should see another type of specialist. In his 
opinion, I now needed chemo-surgery because the cancer had metastasized 
and evidently was deeper than he had previously thought. He explained 
the treatment to me. I would be under the care of a very well known 
chemotherapy specialist. I would not have to be hospitalized for the 
treatment. I would go to the hospital for five to ten days on a daily 
basis from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Special chemicals would be put on my 
face and where an area revealed cancer, the specialist would cut. After 
following this procedure, he told me that if my face did not heal he 
knew of a very good plastic surgeon.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For several reasons, I decided not to follow the 
above path. First, the expense was beyond the means of my husband and 
myself, and second, female vanity. I could not bear to think of going 
out shopping, or going to work with a face any more mutilated with scars
 and blobs than I already had from previous facial operations described 
above. I must mention here that after the second facial surgery when the
 bandages were removed, instead of a scar there was a big blue eruption 
on my skin, which I named "The Blue Blob." The surgeon said it was the 
"cancer showing." I reasoned that since neither the surgeon or the skin 
specialist had cured me — even though I was assured of a cure with each 
bit of surgery I went through — I was fearful of following the road many
 of my relatives had. Too many in my family have died of cancer. I can 
remember hearing the doctors assure them and members of the family that 
they would recover. Doctors assure cancer patients they will recover 
till the day the cancer patients die.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The surgeon/skin specialist recommending 
chemo-surgery wanted me to start treatment immediately. I had quite a 
time telling him I could not do this immediately; that I had to take 
care of business and personal matters first. It was difficult but I 
finally convinced him it wasn’t necessary for me to quickly hop into the
 chemo-surgery program. I promised to call him soon and let him know 
when I would start the chemo-surgery program. I never did call him, but 
his nurse and even he called my husband, urging him to reason with me 
"for my own good."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Right after receiving the "black news," I called my 
husband at work and told him I wouldn’t be back at our place of business
 or home until I found another way to combat cancer. Don’t laugh at me. I
 knew there must be a way to fight cancer without being cut, burned or 
poisoned any more. In the summer of 1971, my husband was tutoring in 
Connecticut. While he was out working one sunny afternoon and I was 
alone in our hotel room, for the first time in my life I prayed to God 
for help. I cried and prayed at the same time. I cried because I was in 
so much pain I let it all out because I was alone and no one could hear 
me. I prayed out loud; I prayed silently. I kept repeating, "If there’s a
 God, then help me find the person who can help me get well." I fell 
asleep crying and when I woke I thought, "Soon I’ll find a way to fight 
cancer."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">While I was talking to my husband, it came to me that
 my prayers for help would be answered by visiting a health store in my 
neighborhood that carried a varied selection of books on the subject of 
health, including cancer. Also, this health store posted notices of 
health meetings which I noted from time to time, but never attended 
because I was working when the meetings were held.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After talking with my husband, I took a subway to the health store and read the first four pages of the Kelley book, <i>One Answer to Cancer</i>
 and got very excited because the symptoms Dr. Kelley describes in a 
cancer patient have matched mine except for the hernia. That condition I
 didn’t have. I begged and pleaded with the owner of the health store to
 help me get to Dr. Kelley. She listened but did not answer. I told her I
 was sure she knew how to help me get the Kelley Test. I broke down and 
cried and told her I had cancer. Then she gave me the name of a person 
to contact.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I had my first Kelley Test in late January of 1972. 
The Kelley Test disclosed that I had only one tumor and that it was in 
the jaw area of my face. Imagine dear reader; Dr. Kelley told me the 
location of my cancer sight unseen; he told me the location without 
subjecting me to painful surgery or biopsies. I say shame on the medical
 profession for ignoring Dr. Kelley.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The first day I began the Kelley regime I took the 
Epsom salt "cocktail" and collapsed on my kitchen floor. Yes, I was that
 full of garbage. I know that today. All my life, until I started the 
Kelley program, I did not eat food to nourish my body; I ate American 
Junk Food — French fries, pizza, soft drinks, potato chips, etc.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Kelley program is not at all similar to any 
program devised today by the Medical Establishment. You don’t take a 
pill or a few pills; you don’t get a shot or a few shots. By golly, you 
have to WORK to get well. I experienced many unpleasant, unusual 
conditions I had never experienced before. I had migraine headaches, and
 all too often, because I went overly "gung-ho" on the program. I 
developed "Flu-like body aches." The Kelley program of purges, enemas 
and colonics, cleaning the liver, kidneys and lungs, changing one’s diet
 — shook up my body — literally. At times I could feel my insides turn 
upside down. Often I felt so "goopy" ill I would complain, "Ooh, how can
 Dr. Kelley do this to me?" When really what I was saying was, "Ooh, how
 did I ever get this sick?" I eliminated parasites and even live worms. 
Our apartment acquired a putrid odor. But then I started having days 
without passing gas! I also had days when I felt as young as a 12 year 
old. Then I would have some rotten, rotten days of feeling just plain 
punky.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I started the Kelley program set up for me in 
February of 1972, I think it’s important to note that the cancer I had 
changed from cancer to a sebaceous cyst and then to a mydiox or mucus 
cyst. When my body was ready, according to the Kelley Test, I had the 
mydiox cyst cut out by yet another surgeon, Dr. W., in 1974 — "The Blue 
Blob" which one Dr. told me I would have to learn to live with was 
removed. And, yes, my face is no longer a mass of scars.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The family physician, Dr. H.H., who was preparing my 
husband to accept my coming demise just couldn’t believe the change in 
my face. When he saw the cancer was no longer there, he said, "My 
diagnosis and the biopsies were wrong; we were all mistaken. You never 
had cancer." I just couldn’t believe his attitude; I can only guess that
 because of his medical training he couldn’t see beyond "The 
Establishment." It is also my guess that if he were to recognize a 
non-toxic therapy, it would negate his schooling and work and further, 
it would be mentally painful because he has lost many patients from the 
dreaded disease of cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Three years ago, in 1975, my husband and I left New 
York City. We now reside in Spokane, Washington. We left the tall 
canyons of the building in New York City for the tall Evergreens of 
Washington State.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I’m lucky; I no longer have to combat the pollution 
that exists in New York City. I find living in a smaller city compatible
 to my health. I enjoy the beauty of nature — birds nesting in an 
Evergreen in our backyard, cats meowing, dogs barking, crickets 
chirping. It’s lots better music to my ear and soul than the honking of 
cabs and cars, the sirens of police and fire trucks.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I work full time. I clean my own house, do the 
laundry, cooking and gardening. I enjoy my grandchildren. I’m happy to 
be alive. I am grateful and say thanks in my prayers every day for Dr. 
and Mrs. William Donald Kelley and the Kelley program.</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley:</b> "Betty brings to mind one 
of the important features of the current cancer situation; many people 
prefer to do nothing than to go through being tortured by chemotherapy 
and radiation and mutilated by surgery. They just ask for pain 
medication and leave. Interestingly, studies have proven that you last 
longer if you do nothing, rather than take a lot of the treatments that 
go on at this time.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"We are coming to a time, particularly in our 
country, where there is hardly a family that has not lost a close friend
 or relative to cancer. And the family has watched this person go from 
fairly robust good health to a skeleton and be tortured by the 
treatments. When you have had one or two friends or relatives go that 
way and the doctor tells you that you have cancer, you don’t jump right 
into the next operating room or in front of the next X-ray machine that 
rolls by. You think about it, you consider it, you remember your 
friends’ or relatives’ story and give it a lot of serious thought."</p>

</font><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY">9-Year Victory Over Bone Cancer.</p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">I would like to tell others what Dr. Kelley’s book, <i>One Answer to Cancer</i>, did for a number of us but more especially just how it began with me.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Doctors had tenderly, but emphatically, told me that 
they could do nothing for my condition. It was apparently cancer of the 
bone — and as lovingly as a father, with tears in his eyes, one doctor 
said: "You’ll get worse until — ?" He left me immediately. Somehow I 
didn’t feel shaken at all. I felt so secure in God’s hands. I knew the 
doctor in the clinic had told my son that it was a matter of 3 to 6 
months. This doctor said the spine was hopelessly deteriorating. Nine 
vertebrae were collapsed. This caused cramps across the shoulders and 
chest. When the attacks came upon me I was in such pain as to have to 
have pain-killing relief by medication. These tablets had such severe 
side effects that I could not endure them.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My bones were brittle and, as the doctors told my 
son, they were like chalk. So small a pressure as a bump of my elbow 
against the ribs would crack a rib. Faith in God as my greatest 
physician helped me to hold steady until one day I was touched by His 
healing power. The healing was instantaneous as to the pain and spine. 
Doctor’s couldn’t believe this but I never took an aspirin or any 
narcotic. There was no pain or cramps. The spine was healed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At this time Dr. Kelley’s book, <i>One Answer to Cancer</i>,
 was laid on a table near my bed. So I picked it up two or three times. 
Finally, I realized I was not gaining strength but the opposite was 
true. However, I never had another pain in my spine nor cramps. So I 
read from Dr. Kelley’s book these words: "Malignancy indicates an active
 pancreatic enzyme deficiency." I began in earnest to read. Every word 
sounded so logical and clear. Cancer always seemed like a killer that 
couldn’t be controlled. The killer was too complex. But Dr. Kelley had 
the key. He was unselfish and tried to put the key on the lowest shelf 
where all of us, little or big, intelligent or uninformed could all 
reach the key to one answer! The diet and nutritional program cost a bit
 but nothing compared to the fruitless efforts of the medical doctors, 
hospitals, etc. So, on my bed of affliction, growing weaker all the way,
 I set myself to follow each step of Dr. Kelley’s instructions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Many times I would think, "Perhaps I am wrong in 
following Dr. Kelley’s diet and nutritional program." Our medical 
doctors wouldn’t listen when I told them about it. But, feeling I had 
nothing to lose, I kept on. Dr. Kelley’s book is most valuable. Here, I 
who knew nothing, was free from those painful unprofitable visits to the
 doctor’s office. Eating differently was never a problem for me — I had 
been a missionary for 40 years. If a diet would help, I thought I should
 get on it as strictly as Dr. Kelley suggested — and not just keep 
eating anything I felt like eating. So I took everything seriously. One 
year later I felt much better; I<i> </i>was up and out on the road in 
the missionary services traveling 20,000 miles one summer. However, I 
felt I needed some guidance so I went to see Dr. Kelley. It had been a 
constant battle to keep on a strict and proper diet with the stress and 
strain of my work.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I have gone abroad three times and carried a heavy 
workload in the U.S.A. to visit among hundreds abroad and at home, and 
to not eat "junk" food takes a backbone of steel and a conviction that 
this nutritional program is best. Stress and strain goes with the public
 appearances and directional work but these five years have been good 
years, although they were not without battles, but I am able to work 12 
hours nearly every day but Sunday.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Even if members of our family and missionary group 
have no cancer, my husband and I urge all to consider the value of a 
nutritional diet as a way of life and health. Our grandchildren are 
being taught the importance of proper diets, purges and careful living. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There are those around us who are dying of cancer 
unnecessarily. We have suggested the Kelley nutritional program to 
people we’ve seen in need, but many have refused to put that much effort
 into regaining their health and are now gone. We’ve seen others who 
have willingly read Dr. Kelley’s book in time, and have found the Key 
and are living examples today of what his program can do.</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley:</b> "When the doctor says you 
have cancer, he gets your attention rather rapidly and God gets our 
attention rather rapidly. We address God immediately. Then we realize 
God has been talking to us all along, we just haven’t been listening. 
He’s been trying to communicate with us in several ways short of 
violating our own free will. The reason that he created us is to let us 
experience life and to have free will, and to come to him voluntarily 
and with love and appreciation — not by force, but because of the love 
that is in our hearts.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"As we address the situation of cancer, we realize 
that we did it to ourselves and this is, to me, the chief characteristic
 of God — his respect for our free will. It’s one of the greatest 
lessons I have learned through the cancer situation, through my cancer. 
God in all of his wisdom and comprehension and completeness and 
knowingness does not force us to do anything — to be right, to do right,
 to be kind to each other — to do anything. He has set the rules, the 
requirements, and the example of how we should conduct our life 
activities, but we are so dumb we can’t figure it all out. He has given 
us great freedom. He has respect for our beings and our persons. He 
allows us the privilege of getting into trouble. When we do get into 
trouble we turn around and blame God. Those of us who get into trouble 
with cancer are learning a pretty tough lesson, but we get the message 
eventually. When we get the message, that it is our fault, we turn, and 
in our pride and haughtiness and all the other things that go along with
 the proper description of us, we humble ourselves and vow ourselves to 
reality and truth and righteousness, and then God can talk to us. I just
 hope those who learn this lesson, as most of my counselees have, don’t 
have to learn it again. Or suffer some other tragedy."</p>

</font><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY">11-Year Victory Over Prostate and Rectal Cancer</p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">When I fully realized that the forthcoming
 biopsy would reveal a malignancy, my emotions completely overwhelmed 
me. That horrible thought which had plagued me for years could and would
 come true.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For many years prior to the actual operation, I had 
been bothered with prostatitis. But with the absence of information and 
having a strong, youthful body, any thought of potential problems were 
quickly dismissed. These were things that always happened to the "other 
guy."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As the years passed by, the problem became more acute
 and visits to the urologist became more frequent. My attitude then 
changed to one of concern.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was granted a brief respite from worry after a 
needle biopsy showed there was no malignancy. But still there was the 
burning and discomfort that intensified when my wife and I would take 
long trips by car. The embarrassment of having to urinate regardless of 
passing traffic played havoc with my nerves. There was a time when it 
became so irritating that it was necessary to visit a clinic in another 
state while traveling, in order to obtain relief. And it was the usual 
prescription of antibiotics. But it did provide temporary relief.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One night while preparing to retire, I sat on the 
edge of the bed to remove my shoes. There was a pain in the rectal area 
that surpassed all other pain. It was impossible to sit. After an 
emergency visit to our family physician brought relief, I returned to 
the urologist and was told there was a nodule on the prostate. This did 
not cause me any great concern until I read about the possibility of 
cancer when a nodule appears.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My procrastination forced my wife to make an 
appointment for me with a local urologist. My medical records were sent 
to him and after an examination and consultation I was informed that I 
needed surgery.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After the operation and a painful recuperative period
 my self-confidence was beginning to re-surface. But the following year a
 devastating bombshell exploded. There was a definite recurrence, which 
manifested itself in the rectal area.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When the second operation was over and my period of 
recuperation felt complete there was another horrible and terrifying 
jolt. There was an elevation in the acid-phosphatase reading. It was 
then I felt totally defeated and resigned to my fate as another victim 
of cancer. However, this resignation was not gracefully accepted. My 
emotions gave way and negative thinking controlled me.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Our son contacted a health food storeowner who, by 
the Grace of God, was familiar with the Kelley program. After much 
insistence by my family, my wife and I visited Dr. Kelley.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The first visit in 1974 was overwhelming when I saw 
the amount of vitamins that were necessary for return to good health. 
There were anxious moments of nausea, dizziness and apprehension 
regarding its effectiveness. But it has proven to be the most 
significant step I ever made. Since that first visit, all medical tests 
and X-rays have been negative!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Each day I pray silently and openly, to thank God, 
our Creator, for His divine guidance in leading me to Dr. Kelley. God 
does act in a mysterious way, and when obeying His natural laws, we all 
prosper.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">And today, at age 67, my life is more complete than 
ever, God in his loving ways, has granted me the ability to enjoy His 
great outdoors. Above all, my spiritual life has risen to greater 
heights in my love and appreciation of Him.</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley:</b> "Walter brings to mind that
 cancer, or any degenerative condition, doesn’t all of a sudden happen. 
It takes a long time to get there. You get sicker and sicker and it 
isn’t all of a sudden you wake up one morning with a full-blown cancer. 
Instead, you have gradually earned every bit of it by your lifestyle, or
 by the dumb things you’ve done, and the abuse you put your body 
through. We earn cancer just as we make either A’s or F’s on our report 
cards. Walter also reminds me that in our society we do tell the patient
 that he has cancer, which I think is a much better attitude than in the
 European society where they do not tell the patient. You go to a doctor
 and he will never tell you what’s wrong with you. He will let you die 
and then tell your relatives after you’re dead, that you had cancer. If 
you were never told, what choice did you have?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"The word ‘choice’ brings to mind our former Vice 
President, Hubert Humphrey, who was a cancer victim. I talked to a close
 friend of Senator Humphrey, who said that when Humphrey had a chance to
 carry out non-toxic therapy he wanted very much to do so. But he 
couldn’t because he thought he would set a bad example by not supporting
 our medical monopoly. He wouldn’t be supporting the National Cancer 
Institute, the National Cancer Society, the AMA, etc. He was essentially
 a sacrificial lamb — as is everybody who goes through the torture and 
inquisitions. He knew he had a choice and chose not to exercise a 
preferred alternative — a real tragedy."</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Health is something I had enjoyed for many
 years, something I had taken for granted, and something I hadn’t 
cherished as I ought. During the fall of 1974, I experienced a very 
tired feeling at the end of my day’s work and often found it necessary 
to rest before preparing my evening meal. At the beginning of February, I
 had a complete physical and Dr. X gave this verdict, "You have a clean 
slate of health." I shook my head and he asked me why. I proceeded to 
explain this distressed feeling in my lower abdomen. The barium enema, 
which followed, revealed the cancer in the colon. You can imagine what 
thought arose within me but I am thankful I have learned, in a measure, 
to accept disappointments too. Our pathway is not always going to be 
sunny and bright.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After the colostomy, the surgeon discovered I had 
cancer of the liver, which was inoperable. He recommended I have 
chemotherapy and an appointment was made to see the oncologist.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the meantime, my daughter, who lives in Iowa, 
contacted a few people who had cancer and had received great help using 
the Kelley nutritional plan. She called me and asked what I wanted to 
do. That was not a hard decision since I had been aware of this type of 
cancer treatment. Nevertheless Mary and I went to talk to Dr. W. (the 
oncologist). He was a real gentleman and did not put forth a successful 
picture of chemotherapy. He wished me the best and said he had never 
heard of the Kelley nutritional plan. My daughter also had to call the 
surgeon to tell him my decision. He made it clear that this was not in 
accordance with the American Medical Association, and this, of course, 
we understood. Am I ever thankful to my daughter that she got in contact
 with people who had proved that Dr. Kelley’s plan really did work in 
bringing people back again to health! </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My daughter helped me in filling out Dr. Kelley’s 
questionnaire. There was a question or two I couldn’t answer so she 
called Dr. X to ask. His manner of speech was shocking. The language he 
used was such no doctor would need to use to answer a question or two 
concerning my physical checkup. His attitude toward my decision was 
distasteful. Dr. X is my doctor no more!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">About seven weeks after my surgery, I made my first 
visit to Dr. Kelley. This was the end of March. The night before my 
appointment with him I got the flu so you can imagine what shape I was. 
My Kelley Index was 720 and my body was so very deficient in every 
respect. I felt very comfortable in Dr. Kelley’s presence and having my 
daughter with me gave me courage.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Before I reached my home I had a distiller, juicer 
and the necessary vitamins and supplements. Now started my new way of 
living. To a degree I understood the discomfort I could experience 
because I had read Dr. Kelley’s book.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There was a tremendous change from my former way of 
preparing my food. I became very time-conscious since I needed some 
supplements every 2 hours during the day and in the middle of the night 
when my alarm helped me out. I had a great number of supplements plus 
all the carrot juice, seeds, nuts, boiled eggs, yogurt, etc. I had lost 
much weight but quite soon I began to gain. I kept on the program for at
 least ten days — more if possible — and then I would vacation for five 
days. There was much to learn in the giving of enemas. A coffee enema 
makes you feel clean and refreshed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This program required much systematic work but I felt
 I had a goal in view, God had spared my life during surgery and now 
with his help I could face the future. Every day I asked for guidance, 
wisdom and courage to walk and live as I ought to so He’d be pleased 
with me here on earth and throughout the endless ages of eternity. My 
relatives and friends all encouraged me to keep on the program. There 
was no opposition. If you feel a course is right, you’ll pursue it. This
 is true spiritually, too. The outside pressure isn’t going to defeat 
you.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At the end of the eight months I made my second visit
 to Dr. Kelley and this time my Index was 420-300 less than my initial 
visit. We all jumped for joy. April 1978, my Index was 10! I am a very 
thankful person.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This body God has given is a marvelous piece of 
creation. It functions so perfectly and isn’t it only right that we 
should feed and care for it properly?</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley:</b> "Mabel is a friend of 
several years and fellow member of our Christian fellowship. She had 
colon and liver cancer. The colon and liver are two of the main 
detoxification systems helping us get rid of toxins. Unfortunately, they
 themselves are high on the list of organs attacked by cancer. Metabolic
 Medicine is built around natural processes, of which proper health of 
the colon and liver and the proper detoxification of the body are major 
factors. Like Mabel, we all take good health for granted and never think
 about having bad health until it hits us. Particularly in the case of 
cancer, we think: ‘it will happen to someone else, it will never happen 
to me.’ We try to not even imagine the prospect. It’s so dreadful that 
we don’t even think it could happen to us.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"A lot of times we are like the proverbial ostrich 
that sticks its head in the sand, and don’t want to know about it, 
trying to ignore it so it will go away. However, as God’s children, we 
owe it to ourselves and to God to take care of our bodies. It may cost a
 little money at first, but it will save money in the long run actually 
to take time out of your life and address the cancer issue. Do the 
Self-Test every 9 to 12 months so that if you ever develop cancer you 
will discover it early.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">"Mabel’s experience with Dr. W. is really more 
typical than her experience with Dr. X. Most family doctors, the ones 
out on the firing line, have our best interests at heart. Generally it 
is not the local family doctor that gives us problems; it is the 
massive, impersonal Medical Establishment."</p>

</font><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY">26-Year Victory Over Cancer of the Spleen, Pancreas and Left Lung.</p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley spoke with Rachael in August 
1998. For 26 years she has told everyone she meets who has a health 
problem about the Kelley program. Rachael wants everyone to know that it
 is because of Dr. Kelley that she has lived to love and enjoy four 
grandchildren and has recently become great-grandma to twins. The 
following is her story:	</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On September 28, 1971, I was admitted to the hospital
 as an emergency case suffering with acute severe abdominal pain. The 
next morning, I was taken to the operating room for an emergency 
exploratory with subsequent removal of an abscessed right ovary and 
fallopian tube (my healthy appendix was also removed). I was told I had 
peritonitis. Several days later, after X-rays of the colon, I was told I
 had three tumors in the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon. The 
doctor said he was "pretty sure at least one was malignant" and I must 
be scheduled for colon resection in 30 days. I asked him what could be 
done if further surgery proved inadequate. He said they would give me 
cobalt.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">On the way home and during the next few days, I 
pondered my predicament. I was in emotional shock and I was weak and 
sick in body. Mentally, I reviewed my symptoms over the past months. My 
health had deteriorated gradually. For at least a year, I had been 
unable to sleep on my left side and more recently I was unable to sleep 
on my back. I felt a pressure-like discomfort in the left upper quadrant
 and under the left rib cage. I also experienced shortness of breath 
when in these positions. I had "night sweats," awakening frequently at 
1:00 or 2:00 a.m. drenched in perspiration. I had a persistent backache 
and low energy level. In the previous six months I had lost 40 pounds. I
 was 45 years of age and, as a registered nurse, I had nursed hundreds 
of cancer patients in various stages of the disease. I recalled some 
painful statistics. The survival rate for metastatic cancer was less 
than 1%. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Later, I learned the primary tumor was in the spleen 
with involvement in the pancreas and lower left lung as well as 
metastasis to the colon. I had a difficult decision to make. I felt my 
body was too weak to withstand major surgery again in four weeks and yet
 my surgeon had told me I would be "very foolish" not to consent to 
further surgery. In my helplessness I claimed God’s promises in James 
1:5; "If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God that giveth to all 
men liberally." As is often the case, God had already begun to answer my
 prayer before I asked. Six months prior to my hospitalization, I had 
read Dr. Kelley’s book <i>One Answer To Cancer</i> and was so impressed I
 stated to a friend, "If I ever have cancer, I think this is the 
treatment I would follow." Little did I realize that within six months, I
 would be faced with that decision. My ultimate decision was to go see 
Dr. Kelley with the thought that I would postpone the surgery until I 
could get my body built up on a good nutritional program.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I went on Dr. Kelley’s program in November of 1971. 
My malignancy index was 700. I sent in a urine specimen to Dr. Contreras
 in Mexico. The test for malignancy was positive. I realized my weak 
body was fighting three major battles — recovering from the trauma of 
surgery and peritonitis, cancer, and severe emotional stress. Every 
three to five weeks, I suffered a healing crisis usually lasting about 
five days. During this time I stopped taking my enzymes. My symptoms 
were an ache-all-over feeling, nausea, abdominal pain, weakness and 
mental depression. I used zone therapy, hot salt baths and hot wet baths
 for pain control to avoid taking pill medication. My family provided 
great assistance and moral support. Friends and neighbors often brought 
fresh vegetables, fruits and nuts. Some even supplied fresh 
non-chlorinated water. Many prayers were uttered on my behalf.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After three months, I went back to Dr. Kelley. In 
spite of all the suffering since the last visit, I felt I was making 
progress. The test confirmed that in fact I had made remarkable 
progress. I decided not to have further surgery unless some emergency 
situation arose such as symptoms of intestinal obstruction.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I continued to improve. My healing crisis became 
further and further apart and less severe. My checkup every three months
 with Dr. Kelley showed remarkable progress. In September of 1972, my 
local physician checked my condition. My blood chemistry was normal, 
colon X-rays were negative and physical examinations revealed nothing 
abnormal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Twenty-eight months later I completed another series 
of tests; X-rays, Pap smear, etc. All were completely negative. By this 
time my night sweats had disappeared and I could sleep comfortably in 
any position. I had gained 20 pounds and my general health and sense of 
well being was better than it had been in fifteen years.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I am indebted to Dr. Kelley and his kind and 
wonderful staff and grateful to God that an alternative has been 
provided for cancer patients who choose not to undergo radiation, 
chemotherapy and surgery.</p>
<b></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b>Dr. Kelley: </b>"Rachael and her husband 
and I have been friends for a long time. One of the blessings that I’ve 
had over these years, along with some of the problems inherent in 
helping to change the course of health care in our society, is the 
friends and friendships that I have been permitted to have. Rachel 
reminds all of those who start on this program that they will have a lot
 of ‘up’ days and many, many ‘down’ days. It is hard, and it’s painful 
and it takes a lot of energy and faith to continue. There is a lot of 
pain involved." </p>

healed myself of cancer (malignancy) and I can cure myself again if it 
ever becomes necessary. Better still, I have learned God’s Law of Health
 concerning malignancy (cancer) and I will ever invoke this Law so that I
 am not likely to have the disease again.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In the old adage "Physician, heal thyself" two things
 stand out to me. One is, if a physician can’t heal himself, how can he 
heal others? The other involves the true meaning of cure — cure for 
anything. It is so often said. "I went to Dr. Jones and he cured me." 
Nothing could be further from the truth. No matter how many years a 
doctor has gone to school, no matter how many college degrees he may 
have, a doctor can cure only one person — HIMSELF. It is important that a
 person understand that only he can cure himself of anything!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is the individual and his body chemistry that cure
 him of disease. In doing this, he must take note that he is physical, 
structural, mental, and spiritual, and that each facet plays a part in 
his cure. His physician or clinician can only bring to his attention 
some of the basic Laws of God concerning health. Unfortunately, many 
clinicians are not sufficiently aware of these Laws, even though they 
are honest and sincere, and try their hardest.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Although I am a clinician, I have no intention of 
treating anyone for cancer or any other disease. I am even more than a 
clinician — I am a teacher. My purpose in writing this book is therefore
 educational: I hope it will instruct you in God’s Laws of natural good 
health — and particularly in those concerning malignancy (cancer) so 
that you can have a body free of this dreaded affliction. I call unto 
Yahweh — "I am that I am" — to bless this publication and send it forth 
to those who have the wisdom and need to use it.</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362631">True Early Signs of Cancer:</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The true early signs of cancer are the signs of inadequate protein metabolism. They are:</p>

<ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Gas on the stomach or bowel</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Sudden weakness of the eyes</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Tired feeling most of the time</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Muscle weakness and cramps — first in the back, then in the chest</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Extreme mental depression</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Sudden change in hair texture or color</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Development of various hernias (only in slow-growing tumors)</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Confusion — difficulty in making even simple decisions</li><p></p></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">I had cancer for more than three years before the 
true nature of the problem ever dawned on me. At the height of the 
cancer, I supposedly had about two months to live. If I had not 
discovered God’s Laws concerning cancer and applied them very 
diligently, I would not be here to share this information.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">With few exceptions, by the time one discovers he has
 cancer he has had it for a very long time. This was my situation. Now 
that I really know all the true early signs of cancer, I also know that I
 was being warned many months before my case became clinical.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">From time to time, I would notice belching just a 
little gas, but I didn’t give it much thought — just supposed I had 
eaten a little too much. Eventually, I began to pass gas from the bowel,
 a little at first and finally so much that it was embarrassing to me 
and also my family. </p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362632">My First Warning:</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">My hobby was antique automobiles. On one 
trip the family made to Colorado in our 1923 Cadillac, I noticed that at
 dusk I found it difficult to read the road signs. I had to be right up 
to them before they became legible. I still didn’t have the good sense 
even to suspect I had cancer, and didn’t give the matter much more 
thought until two months later when I was showing some slides to the 
Antique Automobile Club. I couldn’t seem to get the pictures in focus. I
 thought I had damaged my camera, but the club members said the pictures
 were very clear and that I’d better have my eyes checked. Finally, I 
gave in and made an appointment with the ophthalmologist for an eye 
examination. To my horror, he prescribed trifocals. My protests were for
 naught, and I could see my pictures and road signs much better. </p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362633">My Second Warning:</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Things went on about the same for several 
months, until I began to notice that if I sat in one position for more 
than twenty minutes I would have muscle aches, particularly in the back.
 My physician finally gave me a muscle relaxant, after I’d visited him 
several times with the same complaint. I was still too naïve to suspect 
cancer. The medication didn’t help much, and in another month or so I 
began to have pains in my chest. This of course upset me considerably, 
and I rushed to the physician once more.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Over the next few months, several electrocardiograms 
were made and nothing out of the ordinary showed, it couldn’t, because 
the pain was from the chest muscles — a frequent sign of cancer — but as
 usual, I was oblivious to the true early warning signs. </p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362634">My Third Warning Went Unheeded:</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">A long, long horrible period of mental 
depression followed — another true warning sign that cancer was rearing 
its ugly head. I went to the physician again and practically begged for 
help, asking for an antidepressant drug or anything that would help 
alleviate this chronic, severe depression. By this time, he was fed up 
with me and my complaints and he sat me down and carefully explained 
that there was nothing wrong with me. My heart was better than his, and 
it was high time that I stop worrying about it; after all, it was only 
in my mind!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As cancer progresses, it gives off a toxin that makes
 one extremely depressed, and there is a feeling of impending death a 
good part of the time. Gradually, during the entire three years of early
 cancer growth in my body, I became weaker and weaker. By this time, I 
knew something very tragic was taking place, but I didn’t know what, and
 still didn’t have any suspicion that it might be cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My job, the work I loved so very much, became 
distasteful. I wanted to give it up and start a new profession — 
anything to attempt regaining an interest in life. After all the many 
years of college training for a job I loved to do, I was seriously 
contemplating junking it all. After eight years of clinical practice and
 research, I found myself ready to throw in the towel. It was a terrible
 feeling to be so sick and not be able to understand why or put a name 
on it. My thinking became fuzzy, unclear and irrational. </p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362635">A Fourth Warning — and still not an inkling in my mind what the culprit might be!</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">During these many months of severe 
depression, my hair began showing signs of lifelessness, becoming 
brittle and coarse. I was losing some, and what was left was fast 
becoming gray.</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362636">Warning Five also escaped my attention!</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Also, at this time, I developed a hernia. 
This is typical of a person with malignancy, since the malignancy is 
accompanied by muscle deterioration.</p>
<b><font size="4"><p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="_Toc430362637">My Sixth Warning:</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">By this time I was feeling so bad that I 
reluctantly returned to my physician. He finally admitted that there 
might be something wrong and sent me off to an internist. After the 
passing of three month’s time, during which the Beard Anthrone Cancer 
test had proved extremely positive and I had undergone many other tests 
and diagnostic procedures including X-rays, the internist finally 
suggested biopsies of my pancreas, liver, and intestines. He suspected 
that these operations would reveal cancer. Although the biopsies were 
not performed, the physician’s suspicions were correct.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My wife was privately told not only that I had tumors
 in all three organs, but also that in the doctor’s opinion I had no 
more than 18 months to live. And though I had begun to suspect the 
worst, another month passed before I myself learned of all the facts. 
Meanwhile, the chief surgeon in our locale had ruled out full-scale 
surgery because he thought I was in such bad shape that I wouldn’t make 
it off the operating table alive. My wife had been told to take me home 
and get our affairs in order as promptly as possible, for it wouldn’t be
 long before I’d pass away.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Ironically, though I had been doing cancer research 
for several years, it had never occurred to me that I could have it 
myself. I guess I was just like thousands of people who think it can 
happen to someone else — but not to them. Only the cancer victim can 
understand the fear and despair that finally overwhelmed me. This hit me
 harder, probably, than it would have the average person, because I had 
been studying and researching the details of cancer and had a firsthand 
insight into that horror of horrors.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Since early childhood, I experienced a deep and 
abiding interest in all facets of medicine and I had spent much of my 
life studying anything and everything I could find in the field. I had 
spent two and one-half-years with the military medics and fourteen years
 working my way through college in hospitals doing everything from 
running electrocardiograms to assisting in surgery — viewing firsthand 
the complete gamut of medical practices and witnessing the tragic 
decline and ultimate death of hundreds of hopeless cancer victims.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">With this great deal of knowledge about the medical 
community’s various approaches to cancer, I knew that in spite of all 
the propaganda fed to the general public about success rates with 
certain treatments, there were actually very few people who survived the
 medical establishment’s chemicals, surgical procedures, and radiation 
treatments. I didn’t want to be another one of its statistics.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As soon as I realized my true situation, I decided 
not to take any new patients and prayed that I would be granted time to 
complete the work with the patients already under my care. It took me 
about two weeks to overcome the terrific shock and to wrestle with my 
fate.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After days of intensive thought and prayer, I decided
 not to accept the fate of an early death. Instead, I accepted life and 
my duty to seek out God’s Laws concerning cancer and, if possible, apply
 them to myself and teach them to others.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My doctors had considered performing surgery on me, 
but they didn’t think I would make it through the operation. I was so 
near death. God, in his infinite wisdom, had another path for me. Not 
being able to have surgery turned out to be a great blessing, but of 
course I didn’t see it that way at the time. The only thing I could do 
then was regulate my diet. My life hung in such a delicate balance 
(another blessing), that I could feel very clearly the effect of each 
food I ingested. If I ate wrong foods, I could very easily tell it by 
the way I felt.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As time passed, I realized one of the basic laws of 
cancer: Wrong foods caused the malignancy to grow, while proper foods 
allowed natural body defenses to work and the malignancy was absorbed a 
little. This is one reason some people can live so long with cancer, 
while others succumb very quickly. Through a process too long to 
describe here, I worked out the relationship of enzymes, minerals, and 
co-enzymes, as well as proper detoxification procedures.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By the time I started my program, I was in very bad 
shape. I was extremely depressed, with nothing seeming to work out well.
 I had a feeling of impending death most of the time, was always tired, 
and became completely exhausted at the slightest effort.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The cancer had eaten into the nerve connections to my
 heart, causing rapid pulse rates and irregular beating. My cancerous 
pancreas was so damaged and enlarged that I had hypoglycemia and was 
going into insulin shock several times a day. My liver also was 
cancerous and enlarged. I could not eat much, as I was so nauseated. My 
intestines were so laden with cancer that I was in constant pain. I will
 have scars for a long time to come.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When I finally worked out the total nutritional 
support program, I thought everything would be wonderful and I would 
recover without further difficulties. But I had still another lesson to 
learn. Recovery can be worse than the disease itself. I not only had to 
destroy the cancer, but I had to rebuild a badly damaged body also.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">At first, I was anxious to destroy the cancer as 
quickly as possible, but I found that the toxic poisons made me 
extremely ill. I had to learn how to be sure the cancer was dissolving, 
but not too fast. At the proper rate, one would feel sick, but not 
violently ill.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As the body absorbs the cancer, it overloads the 
blood and liver with toxic poisons, making one feel constantly sick. 
This, for me, lasted about eight months after the cancer growth was 
stopped. All the while, the mental depression remains and the diet 
leaves you with cravings. One has been accustomed to all the tasty 
"junk" and it is very hard to give it up forever.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As one begins to get over the "goopy" sick feeling, 
he will notice that he has a good day when he feels wonderful, then 
several bad days when he feels "goopy" sick again. He enjoys the good 
days so much that the bad ones seem much worse than they really are. Now
 he can realize how sick he has been.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">About the time one is having a few more goods days 
than bad, he starts having muscle cramps — very bad ones. This condition
 goes on for a minimum of nine months, and often much longer, while one 
is rebuilding muscle protein that was taken out of the tissue during the
 early stages of the cancer. This stage is similar to the severe growing
 pains one might have experienced as a child or youth.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">There is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow — 
one’s good health! If all the steps have been faithfully carried out, 
one’s body is in better condition than ever before in many cases. That 
wasn’t true in my case, at least it hasn’t been yet. Although my 
"incurable" cancer is cured, it did a lot of damage and it was five 
years before I was free of pain and felt really good. Nevertheless, I 
was given years of precious, productive living. And if you can first 
find hope and then health through Metabolic Medicine, I will not have 
lived in vain.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The most outstanding study in medical 
history is of Pancreatic Cancer. At the request of Robert A. Good, 
Ph.D., M.D., former president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center 
of New York City, Nick Gonzalez, a medical student, reviewed thousands 
of Dr. Kelley’s patient’s records selecting 22 patients with Pancreatic 
Cancer. Although Dr. Kelley had many more patients who were diagnosed 
with Pancreatic Cancer, only these 22 met the rigid standards required 
in this study: i.e., Biopsy diagnosed at a major medical institution.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Good requested this study, which is called a 
numerator/denominator. In this study, a single form of cancer was 
chosen. Gonzalez chose pancreatic cancer since the five-year survival 
rate in orthodox medicine is virtually zero. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In this study, a total of 22 Kelley pancreatic cancer
 patients properly diagnosed by the orthodox medical community were 
broken down into three groups based on their level of following Kelley’s
 protocol. The median survival of the three groups is shown as:</p>
<b><font size="4"></font></b><font size="4"></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="4"><b>Unit One</b></font>: Ten patients never followed the protocol; average survival 67 days.</p>
<b><font size="4"></font></b><font size="4"></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="4"><b>Unit Two:</b></font> Seven patients followed the protocol partially; average survival 233 days.</p>
<b><font size="4"></font></b><font size="4"></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="4"><b>Unit Three:</b></font> The five patients who followed Dr. Kelley’s protocol completely achieved an average of nine years survival.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In fact, all five were still alive at the time the 
study was made except one patient who had died (of Alzheimer’s) after 
11.5 years.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362639"></a><a name="_Toc430363923"></a><a name="_Toc434240016">*Conclusion*</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">For over 35 years our researchers have had
 the integrity, discipline and stamina to thoroughly investigate the 
parameters of the disease process that is commonly known as Cancer. They
 have addressed this, a most serious issue of our times with honesty, 
integrity, openness and determination that befits the intelligence and 
position of scientific researchers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The highest honor a true scientific researcher can 
ever attain has been attained — that is rejection and condemnation by 
the Establishment. This honor comes to very few in the Academic or 
Scientific Community. No higher honor can be bestowed upon a mere 
mortal. They stand tall beside the great of civilization, such a 
Galileo, Louis Pasteur and Gregor Mendel.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately, the Orthodox and Alternative 
clinicians, doctors, and researchers, for well over the past 100 years 
have been in serious SCIENTIFIC ERROR	 when addressing Cancer. Yes, many
 of these individuals have observed one little parameter of Cancer, but 
they have completely missed the understanding of what Cancer is. Many of
 the Alternative researchers and practitioners have fallen into the same
 scientific error as the Orthodox researchers. More unfortunately, the 
Orthodox researchers and practitioners, have even, with their unlimited 
funding, fallen into complete and total Scientific Error when addressing
 cancer.</p>
<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>They see a Malignant Tumor Mass, and in total
 Scientific Error call it a "Cancer." It is nothing of the sort. This is
 exposing their total ignorance of Cancer. A Malignant Tumor Mass is a 
Malignant Tumor Mass, and in no way can an intelligent scientist call it
 Cancer.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Cancer is a simple failure of one’s own 
pancreas to produce adequate activated pancreatin and deliver it to the 
site of a stimulated (activated) normal Trophoblast Cell (Pre-Placenta 
Cell). This happens to each of us, thousands of times every day. At this
 point the pancreatin produced by the pancreas and activated by 
secretions from the first six inches of the small intestine, circulates 
throughout the body. This activated pancreatin seeks and searches out 
all manner of defective cells, bruises and pre-placental tissue cells.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>These defective cells are digested by the 
activated pancreatin. The white cells then pick up this goopy mess and 
carry it to the LIVER by way of the bloodstream and lymph system. This 
mess has to wait its turn to enter into the liver to be eliminated. Most
 doctors and cancer victims alike, are so dumb they expect the liver to 
do this without their help — and for the most part, the liver must 
accomplish this task in spite of their hindrance.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>All systems of both the Orthodox and 
Alternative Medical Communities, in total ignorance dealing with 
malignant tumor masses are accounted for in Metabolic Medicine’s 
Paradigm. This is noted on page 10. The success rates of these most 
unscientific procedures range from four to at most 30%. Their very few 
successes are accomplished by accident and in total ignorance of 
Metabolic Principles.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>There are a few sincere, naïve, ignorant 
individuals, who in honesty and dedication want to help the CANCER 
VICTIM. However, they do not comprehend what Cancer is and by hit or 
miss, stumble onto one little parameter of Metabolic Medicine’s 
Paradigm.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Most individuals associated with the 
diabolical CANCER RACKET do not want and will not allow the proper 
treatment of Cancer to be known or used. They enlist the aid of the 
Political, Legal and Medical Establishments. It is their objective to so
 deceive the CANCER VICTIM that he/she will run as fast as they can to 
the doctor.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>In their deceptive schemes, these 
Establishment con artists expect and demand that we Cancer Victims 
voluntarily beg the Medical Communities to plunder us and take all our 
assets in blind false hope of receiving proper and adequate treatment. 
What little success is forthcoming is by accident and in total 
ignorance.</li><p></p></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">The Cancer Victim has a Failure of the Pancreas for 
at least two years before a Malignant Tumor Mass develops to a point 
that the physician becomes aware of their condition. Although these 
victims have felt that something was wrong for several months and have 
often gone to the physician for help, with very little improvement 
noted.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When Pancreatic failure progresses to a point wherein
 a Malignant Tumor Mass — A False Placenta — is found, in ignorance and 
scientific error, the physician calls this Malignant Tumor Mass CANCER. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The diagnostic evaluation tools developed by the 
Unscientific Scientific Community — that is, Biopsy, Scans, Blood Tests,
 X-rays, etc. are so crude it is unbelievable. By the time these crude 
procedures are used, it is most often too late for any effective 
therapeutic procedure. Remember the Medical Communities never, ever, 
address CANCER, only Malignant Tumor Masses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Researchers of the College of Metabolic Medicine 
developed a simple, effective and inexpensive Self-Examination Procedure
 for pancreatic failure in the mid-1960’s. The Establishment for obvious
 reasons has suppressed this Self-Examination Procedure. The Procedure 
is carefully outlined on page 15. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This Pancreas Self-Examination Procedure should be 
used once a year to alert one to possible pancreatic failure. This 
simple Self-Examination could put the National Cancer Institute and the 
American Cancer Society out of business within a few months.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">A diabetic going untreated will destroy 
his liver, kidneys, and lungs, develop a gangrenous limb and go blind. 
The physician who performs a liver, lung, or kidney transplant is not 
treating diabetes. The physician who amputates the gangrenous limb is 
not treating diabetes. The physician who prescribes a "Seeing-Eye-Dog" 
is not treating diabetes. The physician who prescribes insulin is not 
treating diabetes. The diabetic who gives himself insulin and changes 
his diet is properly treating his own diabetic condition.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Cancer Victim going untreated will die a 
horrible, painful death. The Orthodox Physician who uses surgery, 
radiation and chemotherapy is not treating cancer. The Alternative 
"doctor" who prescribes herbs, shark cartilage, black salve, laetrile, 
vitamins, etc. is not treating cancer. The Chinese doctor who prescribes
 6 cockroaches and 3 grasshoppers daily is not treating cancer. These 
items may help something else in one’s body, but will not properly treat
 one’s cancer. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Even should these "Quacks" prescribe pancreatic enzymes for the cancer victim, they are not treating cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The cancer victim must treat himself by taking a safe, effective, uncontaminated form of <b>PANCREATIN</b> in adequate dosages and change his diet.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The "Quacks" of our society are not permitted to 
treat cancer, should they choose to, nor do they know how. The "Quacks" 
of our society are only permitted to treat Malignant Tumors and one’s 
purse.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The great charlatans of our civilization, like Wm. 
Rockerfeller with his snake oil, P. T. Barnum with his circus, Barney 
Cornfield with his investment and insurance schemes must look down from 
heaven or up from hell, green with envy and jealousy. They must beg God 
for a chance to be a modern day physician.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">By the time you and/or your physician discover a 
malignant tumor mass, you have had cancer for 2 or more years. You have 
to face the truth that cancer is nothing more than the failure of your 
pancreas to produce adequate pancreatin and your body to deliver it to 
the site of an injury or stimulated defective cell.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The cancer victim does not have to be a party to his 
own plunder and murder. He must properly treat his own cancer, as he is 
the only one who can. He must embark on a "Do-It-Yourself" program.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The cancer victim wants someone else to do it for 
him. However that is impossible, for only the victim himself can 
properly treat his own cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For the time being, it is not illegal to treat yourself. How long will the Establishment permit it? Only God knows.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Those who are wise enough to realize wealth is not 
determined in Silver, Gold or Diamonds should consider obtaining a 
supply of pancreatin. Health is also an important asset.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1904, only one American in 24 had cancer in his 
lifetime. In the 35 years since I cured myself of terminal pancreatic 
cancer and guided some 33,000 cancer victims to health, the <b>CANCER RATE</b> has increased from one in five, to now, as you read this, the <b>CANCER RATE is one in two. </b>And
 the Cancer Industry calls this Progress Against Cancer — the lie, the 
big lie. The War on Cancer is the plundering war of our peoples, not a 
war on cancer. </p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">A young man, Ernest Scott, getting his MS 
from Rockerfeller University in 1911, discovered insulin. This was his 
Thesis. All the great scientists could not figure out what insulin was 
or how to obtain it. It is a most interesting story of God’s direction 
of Ernest Lyman Scott. He presented it to the Rockefeller University of 
Chicago. He submitted the completed document and his mentor professor 
was to publish it. The mentor changed it "for publication" and did not 
publish it. However, the University still has Scott’s original Thesis.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Scott became interested in diabetes while he was 
teaching in High School the year before he started his graduate studies.
 One of his high school students, a football player, did not show up for
 practice. Scott went to the student’s home. There he learned the boy 
had just been told he had diabetes. In 1911 and until the late 1920’s 
and early 1930’s, diabetes was always a death sentence (even as cancer 
is today). The young man said: "What’s the use of playing football, I 
will soon die."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The next year Scott, as a graduate student in 
physiology, was doing experiments on dogs that had had their pancreas 
removed or tied off. When the Diener (a German word for laboratory 
assistant-animal-attendant employee of the university) quit because of 
the fly problem and sticky urine puddles from these dogs, Scott 
immediately figured out that the urine had high concentrations of sugar.
 This led Scott to discover insulin and separate the insulin secretions 
from the pancreatin. No one had ever done that before.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Scott went on to Columbia University to get his Ph.D.
 and remained on staff for years. His Doctorate Dissertation was the 
development of the Standard Blood Test for Diabetes. The story is too 
long to go into here, however, Eli Lilly Co. was only a name on a garage
 until the 1930’s when they started producing insulin by stealing 
Scott’s 1911 insulin process. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In 1997, the Eli Lilly Trust Fund was the richest in the world. It exceeded the Ford Foundation for the first time.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Medical Establishment used the pancreatin part of
 Scott’s research and patented it. They then gave this monopoly to the 
Viobin Company, a subsidiary of the A.H. Robins Pharmaceutical Co.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Essentially Viobin has the worldwide monopoly for the
 production of pancreatin, just as Lilly has the worldwide monopoly for 
insulin.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Medical Establishment gave the 35 million-dollar 
plant, having never been used, that Oscar Myer made to go into 
competition with Viobin when Viobin’s patent ran out in August 1983, to 
the Viobin Company for $5 million in one of their typical procedures.</p>

<ul>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>All Pancreatin comes from one company, Scientific Protein Laboratories. </li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>All Vitamins come from Hoffmann-LaRoche Inc., Nutley, New Jersey.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>All Minerals come from Eastman Kodak Co. in Rochester, New York.</li><p></p></ul>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, from the beginning of time, diabetes was a 
death sentence, until in 1911, when Professor Scott discovered and 
documented the cause and cure of Diabetes. All Physicians had only 
treated the results of diabetes, such as heart, liver and kidney damage,
 gangrene and blindness, but not diabetes. Everything went along the 
same as usual, diabetic patients dying, until the 1920’s when Dr. Scott 
developed and standardized the blood test for diabetes. During this 
period, the Medical Establishment in their pompous ignorance and 
diabolical greed murdered Dr. Scott’s wife and only son. The Eli Lilly 
Co. was given the sole and only monopoly for the manufacture and sale of
 insulin, by the Big Establishment, which controls all monopolies. 
Lilly’s problem was, they could not make insulin. Therefore by stealth, 
deceit and conspiracy, a Lilly conspirator confiscated Scott’s 
procedures and technique for production of insulin. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Medical Establishment then forced Sir Dr. 
Frederick Banting to accept a Doctor of Medicine degree that he did not 
want and in which he had no interest. Next the Establishment gave the 
Nobel Prize to Banting (a very honorable man) and Best (not so 
honorable) to cover up Lilly’s theft of Scott’s scientific discovery. 
Thus, the Big Establishment conferred credibility upon Eli Lilly and 
Company. Lilly has had the monopoly on insulin ever since, making 
hundreds of millions of dollars down through the years.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">So it is today, the physician only treats malignant 
tumor masses, blood and immune system failures. The physician never 
treats CANCER. Four things usually happen to the physician who even 
attempts to treat CANCER:</p>
<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>He is immediately stripped of his license to practice medicine; and/or is</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Thrown in jail for at least one year; and/or is</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Run out of the country; (usually Mexico) and/or is</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Killed.</li><p></p></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">For the time being, the CANCER victim must treat 
his/her own cancer. Legally, one must also allow the physician to treat 
the results of CANCER and plunder and frequently kill the victim. (Dr. 
Kelley’s Pancreas Self-Examination Procedure for early detection of 
pancreatic failure is carefully outlined in Chapter II, page 15.)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I bring this message to you for several reasons. 
First, to remind you how desperately ill Cancer Victims become and how 
easy it is for me to tell them what is needed to regain their health. 
Also, how exceedingly difficult it is for them to do it. Cancer Victims 
have to give up any hope they might have that their Orthodox or 
Alternative Treatments can be more than 20% successful. Although their 
honest physicians tell them this, it remains hard to let go of the 
faintest glimmer of hope. The discipline necessary to do our Metabolic 
Program is a high hurdle for all Cancer Victims.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For example a young man, Scott Stirling, a seriously 
ill cancer victim, came to my little office (a 3-room shack) in 
Grapevine, Texas. At this point, the Metabolic Nutritional Supplements 
were pure and uncontaminated. The Medical Establishment was livid with 
me personally and deceived themselves that I was a ‘health food nut’ and
 no threat to their 100 Billion-Dollar a year CANCER Racket of Plunder 
and Murder.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Scott, of course, like other Cancer Victims, had to 
work very hard to reverse the progression of his terminal illness. Our 
Metabolic Paradigm was and is as true as ‘gravity.’ Like other 
scientists before me who found the Truth down through history, the 
Establishment tries with all their diabolic schemes and tricks to 
destroy the Truth. Truth is a most difficult thing to destroy. If the 
Establishment cannot destroy it, they then make an all out effort to 
control and profit from it, as above in the case of insulin.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I would be doing you the reader, a disservice should I
 fail to tell you the whole story. Hope is a most powerful healing tool.
 However, false hope, dishonest and deceitful, deliberate 
misrepresentation is wickedness to the point of sin. The Cancer Victim 
obtains more than his share of ‘FALSE HOPE’ from the Establishment’s 
Orthodox Medical Community. When the Cancer Victim discerns this in his 
fight for life and abandons orthodox medicine, he is devastated. At this
 point, the Cancer Victim in his search for health, understanding and 
TRUTH falls prey to the ruthless wolves of Alternative Medicine and 
health care. Both Orthodox and Alternative health professionals are not 
necessarily wicked, but they are all ignorant and unscientific in their 
treatment of cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Cancer Victim should take careful note that the 
support organizations of these plunderers also derive their income as 
leeches from the ignorance abounding in the Cancer misinformation mania 
of our civilization. From the American Cancer Society, the National 
Cancer Institute, the various Aids organizations, to the Cancer Control 
Society, to the Cancer Clinics in Mexico, a lot of money and 
misinformation changes hands with very little TRUTH or HELP.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I am taking the liberty of listing briefly some of the techniques used by the Establishment since the 1960’s to <b>SUPPRESS THE CANCER CURE,</b>
 to maintain their control and further their 100 billion dollar a year 
"Cancer Racket." My trials by Establishment experiences have been 
extensive in the field of medicine and particularly the area of CANCER. 
Your first reaction to this is to stop here and mark this off as the 
ranting and ravings of a religious right-wing NUT. However, you do have a
 brain, no matter how washed and laundered and programmed it may be. You
 can still think and reason and know right from wrong; TRUE from FALSE, 
and the ring of righteousness from the thud of wickedness.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What I will communicate to you over the next few pages is:</p>
<ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The Medical Establishment does not want a CURE FOR CANCER and absolutely will not permit a CURE for any reason at any cost.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>CANCER is a very simple dysfunction to properly treat.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The CANCER VICTIM must treat the cancer 
himself as the physicians in our society are not permitted to treat 
CANCER, only the effects of cancer.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>It is most difficult to CURE your own cancer.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The Establishment deceives you with a multitude of tricks.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>It takes dedication and hard work to follow the correct Metabolic Program</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>The Establishment plunders Cancer Victims.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Cancer Victims are used and abused Establishment research animals.</li><p></p></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">While Scott was sitting in my office getting his 
Metabolic Nutritional Program the Establishment was continuing their 
relentless attack on the Scientific Paradigm, which I advanced. This 
attack has been ongoing since I published the scientific treatise in a 
little 38-page booklet, <i>ONE ANSWER TO CANCER</i>, in December 1967. 
Early in 1970 the Establishment had obtained a copy and went berserk, 
promptly throwing me in Jail. Using their Establishment Media, <i>The Fort Worth Star Telegram,</i> the usual smear job belched forth to warn the public of the villain in their midst and to beware of ‘QUACKS.’</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This ruthlessness and lawlessness has gone on since 
the "Garden" which I thoroughly understand from history, as well as 
personal experience. I am reminded of another Dentist, Dr. William T.G. 
Morton, the one who first discovered general anesthesia and the wicked 
ways in which he was treated by the Establishment, even having to suffer
 the theft of his paradigm and being discredited until long after his 
death. Even today the Establishment tries to discredit him.</p>
<b><font size="6"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362657"></a><a name="_Toc430363941"></a><a name="_Toc434240026">THE ESTABLISHMENT</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Many are allowed to rant and rave about 
the conspiracy in the medical establishment and governmental agencies, 
but none are allowed to be truthful and point out or define who the 
Establishment is. To some of them, it is a vague somebody or group 
somewhere out there, who are the bad guys. To others, it is not socially
 acceptable or politically correct to TELL, if they know.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">We politely refer to the ENEMY WITHIN as the 
Establishment. We all know it exists in all areas of civilization: 
Political, Economic, Legal, Education, Health, Media, and Religion. The 
inclusive extent and wickedness of the Establishment is beyond the 
mental capacity of one to conceive and comprehend. The overthrow of our 
government and our institutions is complete. This overthrow of our 
institutions has not been with guns but with words, bribes, stealth, and
 acts of deceit.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When Scott was in my office, I had just gone through 
every court in Texas and the U.S. Supreme Court seeking my First 
Amendment Constitutional rights. However, the Establishment controls the
 courts and said I had no 1st amendment right or freedom of speech, 
freedom of press, or freedom to publish a scientific paper. In fact the 
Establishment was so angry and livid, they claimed the book was 
practicing medicine on anyone who read it. "Dr. Kelley is a clear and 
present danger to Society" (Establishment interests). Only Justice 
William O. Douglas dissented (1971). I am not allowed to have a copy of 
the book.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362658"></a><a name="_Toc430363942"></a><a name="_Toc434240027">DOUBLE JEOPARDY</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The Establishment was so livid and upset 
they forced the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners to remove my 
Dental license for 5 years on the same charges. Double jeopardy is also 
unconstitutional. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Like Scott, almost everyone who visited me, or 
followed this little 38-page booklet, recovered in about 6 months. 
During this period of time, if it took longer than 6 months the victim 
was not following the booklet or continued with chemotherapy and/or 
radiation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To say this upset the local Oncologists throughout 
the country was the understatement of the Century. Among Cancer Victims 
this booklet spread like a wild forest fire. Many Cancer victims never 
visited me, but nevertheless recovered and went on their way to health.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Of course, this was reported to the Local State Medical Boards, which in turn reported to the Medical Establishment.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362659"></a><a name="_Toc430363943"></a><a name="_Toc434240028">TEXAS STATE AGENCIES</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">At this point the Establishment was in a 
real first class Tizzy. They engaged in the practice of sending the 
police to sit outside of my little 3 room shack of an office, stopping 
each one of my dental patients, trying to get a confession that they 
were coming to visit me for treatment of Cancer not for a visit to the 
dentist.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Grapevine, Texas, the site of the dental office, was 
4-5 miles north of the Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport. Counselees flying into 
D/FTW would rent a car and drive to my office. The police would take the
 rental car’s license down, then go to the rental agency and get name 
and address of counselees. In addition to giving the information to the 
Establishment the police would send it to the hometown of the counselee 
so their local police could keep surveillance on them. Many entrapment 
tricks both in Texas and Hometowns were used frequently</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362660"></a><a name="_Toc430363944"></a><a name="_Toc434240029">ANOTHER FIRST</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The Establishment got into such a frenzy 
they engaged the Texas State Comptroller to illegally do their dirty 
work. They were going to stop me at all costs. The Establishment sent to
 my little shack an agent of the Comptroller. It did not bother me a 
bit. In fact I offered to help the Comptroller. The Comptroller decided 
that I owed the Sovereign State of Texas several thousands of dollars of
 sales taxes I should have collected on the food and vitamins being sold
 to counselees. CHANGING THE LAW RETROACTIVELY, a good ol’ Establishment
 Trick he learned from the IRS, who practice it routinely, when needed 
to control a person or destroy him.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The State Legislature specifically by law exempted 
sales tax on food and vitamins. The Comptroller, Bob Bullock (later to 
become Lt. Governor) said he made a specific arbitrary ruling for me [by
 Establishment’s orders]. I just ignored him. Being challenged, the 
Comptroller got nasty and sent his henchmen to threaten me. I told them 
"I’ll make a deal with you. You can pay for a clerk to collect it for 
you. I only work for myself. Or, you can set up a card table outside my 
front door and collect the taxes yourself. I’ll even let you store your 
card table inside my office overnight. You had better have a beach 
umbrella also, sitting outside in the Texas Sun gets hot." Last 
December, I received a Christmas card from Lt. Governor &amp; Mrs. 
Bullock.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Not too long after this, we moved to a tiny town of 
200 in Winthrop, Washington. The Establishment was enraged to a point of
 hate and action. One wintry night our home was burned to the ground. 
All was lost including the older stored medical records and our pets.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">During this period, no Establishment trick was 
overlooked to stop me. The Establishment-controlled Federal agency, 
Internal Revenue Service, used all its reserve tricks, and like the 
Texas Comptroller made up several new rules in their attempt to stop me.
 I guess I was too dumb to let it bother me, and I went right on my way 
helping as many people as God would send.</p>

Establishment has been in an insane Tizzy. No deceit, no lie, no trick, 
no bribe, no MURDER, no use of "the badder and baddest people" were 
overlooked and used to the fullest extent of their creative diabolic 
intent and actions. In their War on me, they attacked on all fronts and 
areas to the full fury of their capacity. They did several things at the
 same time. Many too horrible to write about. I will mention some of 
them; they were all going on at the same time. The battles became 
intense with the Hollywood Actor Steve McQueen..</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362662"></a><a name="_Toc430363946"></a><a name="_Toc434240031">STEVE MCQUEEN</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">Early in 1980 after he had stopped, within
 6 months, the growth of his (McQueen’s) own Cancer tumors, his body had
 encapsulated the dead Liver tumor and several smaller masses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">McQueen felt well and demanded that the unsightly 
bulge on his right side and little nodule on the left side of his neck 
be surgically removed. I was against this at the time but McQueen 
insisted.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">McQueen frequently called me on my 
FBI-tapped telephone. In one call McQueen made to me, he stated in his 
famous hero’s voice, "I’m going to blow the lid off this Cancer Racket."
 This of course freaked out the Cancer Establishment. The FBI then 
leaked it out to the National Enquirer scandal sheet of the CIA. This 
exposure was to discredit me. McQueen was then constantly watched and 
harassed by the FBI, CIA and the Media.</p>

liver was cut open and the encapsulated, dead Tumor fell out on the 
operating table. After surgery McQueen had a talk with me. During the 
night a government agent came into his room posing as a Physician on 
duty and injected McQueen with a blood clotting medication, which was 
the cause of death.</p>

cured his own CANCER using our Metabolic Program and had made plans to 
expose and "blow the lid off the cancer racket." Before he could 
accomplish this, he was murdered as only the Establishment can do it 
with all the fanfare and news media to destroy my program.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When this failed, the Establishment’s next plan was 
to send a mole or infiltrator into the Kelley organization so that as 
close a call as the McQueen episode could never happen again.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A Cornell medical student, Gonzalez, who had failed 
after the second year in medical school, was wandering in and out of the
 unorthodox medical community looking for help for his own mental 
instability and illness. During this fruitless search, Gonzalez stumbled
 onto the Kelley Program, which he mentioned to his psychiatrist.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">With the help of his psychoanalyst, Colter Rule, M.D.
 and wife Betty Gessels, M.D., (high level Establishment members in 
NYC), Gonzalez, and a major faction of the Establishment, forced Robert 
A. Good, Ph.D., M.D., President of Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer 
Center/Institute, to sponsor Nicholas J. Gonzalez’ review of Kelley’s 
records and expose Kelley as a Quack.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This project, being most important to the 
Establishment, led Cornell Medical School to reinstate Gonzalez, as a 
3rd year medical student under Good’s supervision for this project 
dealing with the Kelley Program. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The infighting of the Medical Establishment over this
 project forced the most renowned medical researcher of all history to 
be fired and dismissed from Sloan-Kettering and shipped out to Oklahoma 
City.</p>

 carefully investigate the Kelley Program and get the information to 
expose me as a fraud. This backfired on the Big Establishment as the 
second communication from Gonzalez to Good after Gonzalez reviewed the

<p align="JUSTIFY">Dear Dr. Good,</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I hadn’t meant to write you so soon again, but I’ve 
just finished sifting through the first 139 of Dr. Kelley’s patient 
records and found the initial results interesting enough to pass on my 
findings. While I intend to concentrate on the cancers we discussed — 
pancreatic, colon, lung, perhaps breast — I’ve included all the initial 
results just for interest’s sake.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Again, as I wrote in my first letter to you, I do not
 yet have the actual biopsy reports or other lab data documenting the 
diagnosis, but I have found Dr. Kelley does keep information regarding 
how the tumors were diagnosed.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I found these results, particularly for pancreatic, 
quite intriguing. His overall survival rate for all cancer in this first
 group is 93% — and I have found, going through Dr. Kelley’s records, 
virtually all of his patients have advanced disease. Many have come to 
him <u>because</u> <u>no</u> <u>further</u> <u>conventional</u> <u>treatment</u> <u>could</u> <u>be</u> <u>offered</u>.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The diabolical Cult organization, 
SCIENTOLOGY, had several of their doctors and nurses attend my Metabolic
 Technician Training Seminars. They were using the Computerized 
Metabolic Program on their "sick Church members" with excellent results.
 As is the case with all divisions of the Establishment, they wanted to 
take over the Kelley Organization. They could see millions of dollars in
 income, and control of a whole system of Medicine. They too, sent one 
of their "slick Con Artists," a Barney Cornfield type, to Dallas and 
announced they were to take over the Organization. Just get out of the 
way, we are going to do Kelley a big favor, we may give him a little 
royalty, but most of it he must give to our "Church."</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">This little experience scared my employees
 so badly, they went into a frenzy. They had been planning a take-over 
of the Kelley organizations for some time. Masterminded by my own Lawyer
 and Accountant, they got down to the business of throwing me out of my 
own organizations and taking over.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The Establishment could not depend upon 
Good and Gonzalez, delay any longer, or take any more halfway measures. I
 was a most serious threat to their $100 Billion a year Industry. These 
lawless Establishment Devils went to work and:</p>
<ol type="A">

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The Media is a most useful tool for the 
Establishment. Two encounters of hand-to-hand battle occurred during 
this time by the Media to brainwash the general public of the 
ineffectiveness and danger of the Kelley Metabolic Program </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Establishment’s Tom Brokaw and his "side kick 
authority figure Art Euline, M.D., a Gynecologist" did a first class 
smear job of discrediting me on the NBC TODAY show.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Several months later, BBC with Prince Charles 
produced a real hatchet job on me. I had several contacts (friends) in 
England, one was a former Jehovah Witness from New Zealand, and one was a
 Mormon from the U.S. A few months before the BBC show, I went to London
 and made the rounds of available hospital facilities from the Florence 
Nightingale to the City Hospitals. These backers had agreed to 
financially support moving the Kelley operations to England. Using the 
FBI-tapped phone lines, the Big Establishment both in the United States 
and England went into a tizzy over this, and dispatched their number one
 BBC documentary crew to Dallas to interview me and make a despicable TV
 program with Prince Charles introducing it. The program was scathing 
and intended to stop anyone in Europe from working with me.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Scott and several of the Kelley patients were 
requested by BBC to come to Dallas for the filming at their own expense.
 The patients can verify how desperately ill I was at the time from the 
Establishment’s poisoning.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The next battles with the Establishment 
were a series of premeditated Murders by the Establishment. These 
murders were carried out in two stages involving several hundred cancer 
victims and several children with Cystic Fibrosis.</p>
<b><font size="6"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362673"></a><a name="_Toc430363957"></a><a name="_Toc434240040">STAGE ONE</a></p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The A.H. Robins Co, like the Eli Lilly 
Co., was given the sole worldwide monopoly for pancreatin by the Big 
Establishment. Pancreatin was the only nutritional supplement used by 
all of the Kelley patients.</p>
<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362675"></a><a name="_Toc430363959"></a><a name="_Toc434240042">MURDER, DECEIT, FRAUD, MURDER</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The first procedure used by the 
Establishment to put an end to me was the development of a process by 
which to fractionate the Whole Pancreatin into the various individual 
enzymes. In fractionating the Pancreatin they were able to remove one of
 the major enzymes and make it unavailable to the nutritional market. 
They continued to market the defective pancreatin to the unsuspecting 
health food market. Supplement manufacturers never knew why their 
products would no longer be effective for a multitude of nutritional 
needs. When I personally informed these manufacturers I was threatened 
with legal action. Being aware of this, I adjusted our Metabolic Program
 to compensate for this fraud. I went right along helping the Cancer 
Victims, but instead of a 6-month procedure the program had to be 
extended for 18 to 24 months. The cost was also greatly increased.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Establishment, by removing needed active 
ingredients in the raw materials sold to the companies making vitamin 
tablets, assumed the Kelley Program was doomed to total failure. 
Although I altered our Metabolic Program to compensate for this, those 
who now claim they have the Kelley Program and supplements are deceiving
 themselves and the Cancer Victim, for this is the state of PANCREATIN 
and their fraudulent programs of Cancer Cures to date.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Chymotrypsin removed from pancreatin is now sold 
to manufacturers of sewer and septic tank cleaners and not available to 
the medical community or health food store industry.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">My fellow researcher, Dr. Carol A. 
Morrison, M.D., F.A.C.C., found that the A.H. Robins Co. laced the 
Pancreatin they were marketing to the Medical and Health Supplement 
industries in our country with a deadly bacteria, B. cereus 
(Gram-positive Endospore-forming). This infection is a member of the B. 
Anthraces (ANTHRAX) family, and is totally undetectable in the human 
body by any known medical procedure, laboratory or biopsy, until 
recently. Like Anthrax it is always fatal unless properly addressed 
immediately. This infection is part of a wide experimental biological 
warfare program being conducted by the highest levels of the Medical 
Establishment. The Establishment for several years has used this 
experimental biological agent.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Establishment, which controls the U.S. 
Governmental Agencies, has several purposes in mind when infecting 
various parts of the population with Biologicals, both natural and man 
made. One objective being the destruction of the Pancreas with the 
resulting astronomical increase in diabetes and cancer. Another goal is a
 form of genocide for select racial groups. Remember the Establishment 
has been doing for a long time what they accuse others of doing.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The Establishment politicians passed 
legislation to declare WAR upon CANCER. Thus, they went to Fort Detrick 
and took down the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Warfare department 
SIGN. They then placed two signs on the front gate of the facility: on 
the left, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE (NCI), and on the right, WORLD 
HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO). This was and is properly ballyhooed by the 
Establishment Media, and financed to the tune of several hundred Billion
 Dollars yearly from American taxpayers.</p>

Garden, we cannot blame her. For even today the enemy within is 
deceiving us. Of course, the most evil and mad scientists of all

 the Establishment enemy within, who are relentless and determined to 
Plunder and Kill you at any cost. ‘False Hope’ is not my objective. To 
be realistic, we have two enemies, CANCER and the ESTABLISHMENT. Of 
course there is HOPE, you must have Pancreatin and other Metabolic 
Nutrients to treat your Cancer properly. However, you must <u>use discernment</u> <u>in obtaining it</u>,
 and be aware of the multitude of Con-Artists who make claims for their

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">There will never be a CURE for Cancer 
until the Establishment can accomplish their objectives by permitting 
it. Their primary goals are money and control. What big conglomerate 
will get the blessings of the Big Establishment? Nothing happens on the 
world scene that is not planned and designed by The Big Establishment.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">After 30 years of planning Metabolic 
Programs for some 33,000 Counselees and developing the scientific 
Paradigm for the PROPER CURE AND TREATMENT OF MALIGNANCY, I would like 
to share some of the conclusions.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">First, we fall victim, not only to cancer, but also 
to the very clever brainwashing of our number one ENEMY. The Medical 
Establishment and the unending barrage of the conspiracy with the MEDIA 
and support groups such as the American Cancer Society, the National 
Cancer Institute, the American Medical Association and an unlimited 
number of organizations that make their income from the crumbs that fall
 from the establishment’s table.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Second, our number two ENEMY is the simple metabolic 
malfunction of our Pancreas. This is a minor enemy compared to our 
enemies number one and three. In our Metabolic Paradigm we find 
approximately 20 causes for this failure.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">All successes and failures of all cancer programs are
 accounted for by our Paradigm. It would not be a truly scientific 
Paradigm if it did not include <u>ALL CANCERS</u>, which it does.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Third, our number three enemy is ourselves. It is 
quite a shame that Yahweh, God Almighty, gave each one of us a decent 
brain (heart in Scriptural terms), but we do not know how to use it, as 
we have very little, if any practice. We depend upon others (with 
inferior hearts) to do our thinking for us. In short, we go a Whoring 
after false Gods and the false idols put in front of us by our enemy 
number one.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Those Cancer Victims whom God has blessed with enough
 time (6 months) and who have awakened from their stupor, in 
self-defense, figure things out for themselves. Their discernment that 
their Physician, their Medical Community, the Establishment, the MEDIA 
and their Government with its multitude of Bureaucracies have conspired 
in fraud, plunder and murder against them, — the SHOCK, is nearly 
overwhelming and devastating to say the least.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Fourth, at this point, in self-preservation, the 
Cancer Victim rebels and in righteous indignation, often going berserk. 
But at least he realizes he cannot trust or depend upon the Orthodox 
Medical Community or the Government to protect and help him, but only 
deceive, plunder and murder him. Also he comes to the realization that 
if he survives he must "do it himself" and find the answers in spite of 
the ESTABLISHMENT’S interference, promises and brainwashing.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Fifth, in this state of abandonment, the Cancer 
Victim in ignorance and desperation becomes vulnerable and prey to the 
other vultures — the Alternative Medical Community. The alternative 
medical community is composed of the most skilled CON-MEN and CON-WOMEN 
in our civilization, falsely deceiving, like the Orthodox, that they 
have the answer and that they are persecuted scientists and promoters of
 truth. These despicable creatures would put ol’ P. T. Barnum, Wm. 
Rockefeller and Barney Cornfield to shame; their techniques of deception
 are superb. Many of these creatures also deceive themselves and are 
pathological liars and psychopaths. The remainders are ignoramuses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Somewhere along the line, the Cancer Victim turns to 
Almighty God and asks for deliverance, healing and help. When God sends 
help, like placing this booklet in front of their eyes, they refuse to 
accept it, spitting in the face of God, blaming God for their condition 
and finally turning from God to their own ignorance.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Sixth, my experience with Cancer Victims over the 
years has taught me a great deal about the mindset of these 
"Do-It-Yourself" survivors.</p>
<ol type="A">

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Many choose to continue to follow all the 
recommendations and treatments of their orthodox physicians, while at 
the same time, do our Metabolic program. This is usually disastrous and 
only about 6% survive.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Some Cancer Victims, after their orthodox 
physician tells them the treatments are not effective and no further 
help can be expected, start our Metabolic Program. Experience has shown 
that 93% of these individuals who live long enough to stay on the 
Metabolic Program for 12-18 months recover completely and go on to live 
normal useful lives.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Often the Cancer Victim goes berserk and 
while accusing his orthodox and/or alternative doctor of being an 
ignoramus and not knowing what he is doing, ends up doing exactly the 
same thing. He tries to <u>play</u> <u>doctor</u> without adequate 
scientific understanding. This seems to be an ego builder for the Cancer
 Victim. However, this is not successful and in the end is usually 
fatal.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Nearly everyone thinks that if a little bit 
of something is good, then a lot of everything is better. This results 
in about 9% effectiveness as well as unnecessary expense. To many, this 
is a fun game and entertaining. They say to themselves: "If I have to 
go, I might as well have a blast!"</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>For those who have a great deal of wisdom and
 discernment along with 6 months’ time, while following a Metabolic 
Program carefully, are almost always successful.</li><p></p></ol>

<p align="JUSTIFY">Like in diabetes, the Cancer victim must always 
support his defective pancreas with proper diet as well as effective 
enzymes. He must remember, proper enzymes are difficult to obtain and 
always expensive.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Seventh, many Cancer Victims having been brainwashed 
by the Establishment, give up, believing they can never recover their 
health, seriously consider SUICIDE. If they elect to do this, there are 
several choices they can make.</p>
<ol type="A">

<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Go first class and be slow about it. Return 
to the Orthodox Community. Here you will have all the sympathy of the 
National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, Hospice Inc., 
The American Medical Association and many others. They will brainwash 
you and your loved ones with "Oh, how brave and heroic you are, what a 
valiant fight you made." All the while plundering your estate and your 
loved ones.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Go to Detroit, Michigan and obtain the help of the suicide doctor if your doctor won’t give his help.</li><p></p>
<p align="JUSTIFY"></p><li>Go to the interstate highway and jump in front of a Semi. At least this will help your lawyer send his kids to college.</li><p></p></ol>

<b><font size="5"><p align="CENTER"><a name="_Toc430362690"></a><a name="_Toc430363973"></a><a name="_Toc434240055">LETTING GO</a></p>
</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">The most difficult procedure for the 
Cancer Victim is to let go of the false hope that both Orthodox and 
Alternative Medicine uses to control and plunder one. Frequently, due to
 their ignorance of the simple CANCER CURE the condition is fatal.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The programs we had developed were functional until 
30 August 1986. At that time, I gave up my practice of Metabolic 
Counseling and unplugged my computer because of activities of employees 
and doctors I had trained. I would not or will not be party to the 
plunder, fraud and conspiracy of CANCER victims and Metabolic 
Counselees.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Any program available today in my name (or claiming 
to be the ‘Kelley Program’ or better than the Kelley Program) are frauds
 and those who are issuing them should be considered a danger to your 
being. In giving the Cancer Victim HOPE and not <u>false hope</u>; my 
involvement is conditional upon giving the reader the complete story, 
not only of the plight of the Cancer Victims and the Metabolic Paradigm,
 but the missing nutrients for the cancer victim. Also, the Medical 
Establishment’s all out effort to suppress the CANCER CURE and protect 
their interests and lawlessness. My interest is to provide a sound, 
reliable understanding and effective Metabolic procedure to supply the 
required Metabolic support.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My objective as a teacher is to provide you with, if 
you choose, the necessary data by which to live a long and useful life, 
never dying of Cancer. I would much rather have your friends and 
relatives read in the obituary column — you died at age 95 from gunshot 
wounds, inflicted by a jealous lover — NOT FROM CANCER! </p>

toothpaste), presented studies to the U.S. Public Health Service, 
showing that "fluoride tested positive as a cancer-causing agent at the 
lowest concentrations used." According to Charles Eliot Perkins, a 
research chemist sent to Germany to take charge of the I.G. Farben 
Chemical Industries after World War II, repeated doses of fluoride were 
used to make people submissive to the government. He wrote, "In the rear
 occiput of the left lobe of the brain, there is a small area of brain 
tissue that is responsible for the individual’s power to resist 
domination. Repeated doses of fluorine will in time gradually reduce the
 individual’s power to resist by slowly poisoning and narcotizing this 
area of brain tissue and make him submissive to those who wish to govern
 him. I was told the scheme by a German chemist who was an official of

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">I first met Dr. Kelley six years ago. I 
had taken a seriously ill member of my family to him for an evaluation 
and a "nutritional" program. What I got was a fascinating and 
provocative experience about a new way to live healthfully, and a whole 
new concept of what physical and spiritual health is all about. This was
 all in addition to a nutritional program. While I did not understand at
 that point exactly all the ramifications of his approach, I was so 
intrigued that I decided to go on a program myself. Part of doing this 
was to test for myself whether it really was possible that Dr. Kelley 
had developed a method for applying his theories.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My own physical problems resolved around long-term 
exhaustion of what I now know as my sympathetic nervous and glandular 
systems. Medically, this encompassed several diagnoses including 
irritable colon and mucus colitis, severe low blood sugar, intermittent 
episodes of high blood pressure, depression, and very erratic and low 
energy patterns. These are all called: "burn-out."</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">What I noticed over the years was a disappearance of 
all my symptoms, the return of energy, endurance, and interest, which I 
could count on. I knew something vitally important had happened in my 
body and did not quite understand how that had been accomplished and so 
decided to study with Dr. Kelley in order to find some answers to that 
apparent riddle. What I discovered was a simple theory that addressed an
 extremely sophisticated piece of machinery — our bodies — in a new and 
comprehensive as well as therapeutically effective way.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Over the last two years I have incorporated the 
program in my practice and have seen all types of people responding 
well, providing they commit themselves to doing the program thoroughly. I
 would also like to emphasize that the program is a dynamic and ever 
developing one, so much so that the changes incorporating new knowledge 
make year-old programs seem like ten years old.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Over all, I believe that Dr. Kelley’s program is 
sparked by a special sort of genius decades ahead of its time, and will 
be a paradigm of medical care in the future.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">An open letter to my Colleagues, April 
1982. The prevailing orientation of the traditional medical community 
over the past 150 years, with regard to cancer and other degenerative 
disease processes, has been largely a destructive, anti-symptomatic 
phenomenon. Admittedly, these approaches have some absolute applications
 for limited, short-term therapy, but in my strong opinion 
anti-symptomatic therapies have no validity in the treatment of 
long-term disease. What is and has been needed for some years is a major
 re-evaluation of the medical scientific doctrine and the establishment 
of a more appropriate model for the understanding of health and disease.
 Hopefully, this new model could redirect the investigative energies of 
the research community on to more rewarding horizons.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I feel that the time has come from both the 
scientific and humanistic viewpoints, for a change in emphasis from the 
disease process itself to the person who has the disease and from a 
position of fighting against disease to one of re-establishing and 
preserving good health. One of the major contributors to the proposed 
changes in medical thought has been Dr. William Donald Kelley, a dentist
 by profession, who developed a self-sustaining, cohesive model which 
largely explains and properly categorizes volumes of seemingly divergent
 scientific information, theories, observations and experiences. The key
 is biological individuality. Dr. Kelley’s genius is in developing an 
entire scientific model beginning with the individual and his inherent 
uniqueness.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">A major reorganization of thought and practice is 
required of the medical community to utilize the tools, which have 
become available as a result of his model. I have used Dr. Kelley’s 
Metabolic Medicine program for several years and the results, I can 
assure you, are most gratifying.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">As a periodontist, I soon became convinced
 that to treat those things in the mouth that cause gum disease is only 
partial treatment. Based on a great deal of evidence, I was convinced 
that if the body of the patient was well nourished and the machinery in 
the mouth was working properly the patient will not have gum tissue 
breakdown.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As a result of this thinking over many years, I have 
taken several nutrition courses. Thanks to time spent with Dr. Roger 
Williams, and a great deal of reading and studying, I had established 
specific criteria for a nutritional program. With no exception, (and 
that was not a program I could easily use in my practice) none of the 
nutrition courses satisfied my criteria.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">International Health Institute’s (Dr. Kelley’s) 
program was the first program I saw that at least on paper appeared both
 to be practical and to fill my requirements. However, since I had been 
led down umpteen primrose paths by other "nutrition" programs, I was 
very skeptical of the Metabolic Medicine program.</p>
<p>When, with great skepticism, I started my own Metabolic Medicine 
program, I felt I was in excellent health. I had only one health problem
 that I was aware of and that was that I had nasal polyps, which were 
caused by allergies.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The polyps were particularly bad in winter. I could 
not breathe through my nose at all. So after having the polyps 
surgically removed I was referred to an allergist. The allergist found I
 was allergic to dust and all dairy products. I already knew about the 
allergy to the dairy products because after a heavy dairy meal, my nose 
would completely close due to the swelling of the polyps.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To control the growth of the polyps, the allergist 
recommended weekly "allergy shots." For two years, they worked well and I
 could breathe fairly well through my nose in the winter. During the 
third and forth years, the allergy shots did not work as well and I had 
trouble breathing through my nose. During the fifth and sixth years, the
 allergy shots did not work at all. I couldn’t breathe through my nose 
at all in the winter and very little in the summer. My allergist now 
informed me the only thing that would help me were cortisone injections.
 Knowing the undesirable effects of cortisone, I refused.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Things got bad enough that finally I had one cortisone injection.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When I began my Metabolic Medicine program, I 
informed Dr. Kelley of my allergy to dairy products and asked him if 
anything could be done to help. To my surprise, Dr. Kelley said he was 
not at all interested in my specific allergies, but he was interested in
 getting the body working right so I would not be allergic to anything. I
 was very doubtful of Dr. Kelley and the entire program at that time.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When I filled out my Nutritional Evaluation Survey, I
 discovered many health normalities that I never knew existed. Filling 
out my survey, indeed, was an experience in self-discovery and 
understanding. If the information and the claims for what it indicated 
were correct, this was the most valuable physical examination and 
insight into my inner workings I had ever experienced. However, I had 
grave reservations as to the truth of diagnosis made from this 
information and the blood test and urinalysis.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Therefore, I went into the program not only 
skeptical, but almost with a chip on my shoulder. Based on past 
experiences, I felt sure I was wasting my time and money.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I have now been on the program for several years. 
Even during the first winter, with no allergy shots, no cortisone (and 
no allergist), my nose was open all winter. I could breathe through my 
nose!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Being suspicious, I could not give the Metabolic 
Medicine program full credit for my feeling so good. So I went back to 
my Metabolic Medicine’s Self-Test book and compared all the signs and 
symptoms with where they are now. By checking these signs and symptoms, I
 had an objective way of seeing what this program was doing to my 
internal machinery!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">To put it mildly, the Metabolic Medicine program has 
been a great success for me. My allergies are under control. I have 
never felt better. In addition, with the Metabolic Medicine’s Self-Test 
book, I have been able to see objectively what is happening with me. 
With these objective observations of myself, with certainty, at least 
for me, the program is an unqualified huge success.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Now that I am convinced, I am offering this program 
to all of my dental patients. I know it does the job. I know it is what 
we need to get our internal machinery to do the job.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">My training as an optometrist started long before I entered Northwest Illinois Optical College in Chicago, Illinois, in 1992.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As a farm boy, I had the opportunity to observe the 
habits of animals, both domesticated and wild, and in those days mankind
 was living closer to nature and using none of today’s processed foods. I
 am 84 years young, and I see that it’s quite difficult for this present
 generation to realize how the pioneers existed and thrived with very 
few fatal degenerative illnesses such as cancer.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">In any "health" profession, the practitioner has a 
good opportunity to observe the results obtained by the various 
modalities of treating the physical defects of his or her patients. It 
is estimated that 85% of our learning is acquired through our eyes.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When I got out of college and started to practice my 
profession of fitting glasses, I soon realized that there must be an 
underlying cause of so much myopia (nearsightedness), cataracts, 
glaucoma, etc. As I gave the subject more study, it was clear to me that
 man was creating most of his eye problems by incorrect diet and poor 
choice of foods.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">For this reason, I took several courses in 
naturopathy and studied and read everything I could find in health books
 and magazines that dealt with the subject.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Many of my patients are so nearsighted that they are 
unable to see 20/20 on the eye chart. It is quite common for them to 
blame watching television and thus avoid the real cause, which is faulty
 diet and junk foods. Through the science of iridology, it is quite easy
 to observe unhealthy body conditions as well as deposits of drugs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I always try to emphasize basic health principles 
such as the importance of proper diet and tell my patients to avoid 
sugar, soft drinks and refined foods. Some will listen and, if they do, 
in a very short time their eyesight will improve. I have even had cases 
where I was then able to reduce the strength of the lenses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One patient, aged 75, had cataracts. I sent her to an
 Ophthalmologist, and he told her she would have to have surgery in 
three months. I told her of Dr. Kelley’s nutritional program and my 
wife, who is one of Dr. Kelley’s Technician’s had her evaluated. She 
followed the program and when she returned to the Ophthalmologist, he 
told her she would never have to have the surgery.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Another patient quite suddenly lost 70% of her 
eyesight. She went on Dr. Kelley’s nutritional program and in a matter 
of six weeks her eyesight returned.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When Dr. Kelley says we have been starving for 30 years, I certainly agree for I am in a position to observe this.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley is no less than 75 years ahead of his 
time. Although this book deals primarily with cancer, that is by no 
means the limit to his concepts and abilities. I have seen many of the 
patients with other degenerative disease respond equally as well as the 
cancer patients.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">I had always held nutrition of some 
importance and often gave my patients rather inconsistent advice about 
"improving your diet" or "why not try this vitamin for that symptom?" 
After several years of dealing with sick people, some of whom I knew 
were on good diets, and some junk eaters, I began to realize that we 
were healthy not solely as a result of our intake, but instead, we were 
healthy or sick as a result of what our bodies did with the intake. It 
was discouraging to suggest the same "balanced" diet for several 
patients, getting entirely nowhere with many and having dramatic 
positive responses from others. Searching through the available 
literature seemed to add to my questions rather than provide answers.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Several years ago a very dear friend developed cancer
 and my wife was in to accompany her to Dr. William Donald Kelley. Like 
may others, I had heard of the success of Dr. Kelley in working with 
cancer patients and at that time could think of his nutritional program 
only as a cancer therapy.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After meeting Dr. Kelley and observing his simple, 
systematic investigation of the individual body chemistry of our friend,
 my wife telephoned from Grapevine, Texas, and insisted that I 
immediately come meet this man, as she knew his logical approach and 
reasonable conclusions would appeal to me. Early the next morning I was 
1100 miles from the luxurious surroundings of my suburban Chicago 
office, seated in a tiny frame house in a small Texas town. I forgot my 
surroundings, however, as I soon realized that here was a man who not 
only was answering my questions but was re-opening doors in my mind that
 had long been shut.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">As I got better acquainted with Dr. Kelley, I soon 
realized that any help his Metabolic Medicine’s Cancer Cure program gave
 to cancer patients was incidental to the balancing of their individual 
body chemistry. I began to apply these principles as "nonspecific 
metabolic assistance" to meet my patient’s individual needs. These 
programs have been so successful in helping gain and maintain health for
 many that I would like to call your attention to the "non-cancer" 
aspects of Metabolic Medicine’s concepts such as Dr. Kelley’s Self-Test 
for The Different Metabolic Types. I consider it my privilege to 
encourage you to carefully study this book and expand your horizons of 
good health.</p>

</font></b><p align="JUSTIFY">This book is for those who have a strong 
belief in the principle that the body can heal itself and that nutrition
 is one of the keys to that healing. Nutrition has never before been 
approached as systematically and as aggressively as by Dr. Kelley.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I was originally attracted to the field of 
Naturopathy because of my belief in our natural healing forces and it is
 the same belief that has given me faith in this type of approach.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Food is more than separate nutritional factors; 
rather it is a combination of nutrients that keep our body chemistry 
balanced and our organs in harmony and functioning optimally. So taken 
one step further, it is used not only to prevent disease or degeneration
 but, important to many of us, it may be used for regeneration and the 
removal of disease.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">This new book will show that Dr. Kelley is constantly
 perfecting his work so it may help the most difficult cases and shed 
light on our biochemical individuality. This is truly the most important
 key to the development of a successful health program and this is why 
this book offers an avant-garde concept for today’s health needs.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Doctors from all the professions are searching for 
the "magic bullet" that will prevent disease and maintain health. Some 
expect to find it in a synthetic drug and others in a particular natural
 substance, but the search is in vain for we must appreciate our body’s 
holistic needs and one agent alone cannot satisfy this. This approach 
considers nutrients for all the body’s systems.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I anticipate further insights into one’s well being 
and greater health benefits for the people that follow and use the 
information in this book. Superior health services are already available
 to us. The IHI founded by Dr. Kelley is the first fruit of this 
research. Later I expect these methods of analysis to act as a bridge 
between the different professions for the betterment of mankind.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">It is a great joy to be part of this advanced system 
of healing. I appreciate the honor Mr. Rohé has afforded me by asking me
 to share my thoughts. I believe I represent my profession when I say 
that we are grateful to the past achievements of Dr. Kelley and cheer on
 and support future successes.</p>

<i><p align="JUSTIFY">Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most 
pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing happened.																
					      —Winston Churchill</p>
</i><p align="JUSTIFY">"William D. Kelley, D.D.S." That’s what I put in 
the space marked "Father" on the hundreds of forms I have had to fill 
out in my time. In the space marked "Father’s Occupation," I put "Health
 Researcher." That’s about all the information I volunteer without a 
darn good reason, though. To my frequent embarrassment, my father has 
managed to attain a certain degree of fame. Euphemistically, he can be 
said to be controversial. Those less kindly disposed toward him might 
use the term "infamous." In any case, I have always found it easier 
simply to avoid him as a topic of casual conversation.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When we lived in tiny Grapevine, Texas, everyone in 
town knew of my dad. He was the dentist in the little yellow office on 
Worth Street who didn’t appear to be practicing dentistry. His patients 
didn’t come from across town; they flew in from across the country. And 
the people coming to see him were all so desperately ill; many of them 
were cancer patients, obviously on their "last legs." Just what was 
going on in the small office?</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The Fort Worth Star Telegram answered that question 
in a "shocking expose," which set the town buzzing. Dr. Kelley, an 
orthodontist, was seeing cancer patients! Further, the "therapy" he 
suggested was largely a matter of altering the diets of his patients and
 giving them vitamins and such! The notion that an individual’s diet 
might be a factor in a disease as serious as cancer was considered 
absurd, but only slightly less so than the idea of a dentist working 
with cancer patients in any capacity. The scandal instigated by this 
article was the first I remember. Unfortunately, it was not the last.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">My father became involved in cancer research first as
 a patient. In the early 1960’s life in this family was relatively 
normal. At that time, we lived in Midland, the tumbleweed capital of 
Texas. Dad was practicing orthodontics, and his practice was thriving. 
He belonged to the local country club, the school board, and the Church 
of Christ. In his spare time, he indulged his passion for "tinkering" by
 restoring antique cars. His pride and joy was named Twinkles, a 1923 
Cadillac that ran like a top in response to his diligent and loving 
care. </p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I would like to think that my father, given a choice,
 would not have changed much in his life. However, he wasn’t given the 
option.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dad became ill in 1963, and critically so by 1967. 
The physicians he saw in Midland and Odessa couldn’t find anything 
physiologically wrong with him for quite some time. The fact that he was
 ill was undeniably apparent; he was so weak, he found it necessary to 
lie down at the office between seeing patients. After he suffered what 
appeared to be two heart attacks, a diagnosis was finally made. The 
situation, I have been told, was as follows. He had cancer of the 
pancreas and liver. As is usually the case, the malignancy was in its 
final stages at the time of diagnosis. The doctor refused to operate, 
saying Dad would die on the table. He should "get his affairs in order" 
quickly; he could expect to live only a few months. The doctor took my 
mother aside to tell her that, in his opinion, two months was a more 
realistic time frame.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">One of the many reasons cancer is such an effective 
killer is its ability to destroy completely the individual’s will to 
live. The patient suffers overwhelming pain, and his prognosis is rarely
 very optimistic. Any strength he might possess to combat the disease is
 soon exhausted, and death ceases to be viewed as something to be 
avoided. In death, the pain will be gone. The patient will no longer be 
forced to face the people he loves and the sorrow his suffering has 
brought them. Death becomes a friend, not an adversary. My mother and 
grandmother Kelley have told me stories of how terrible a thing it was 
to watch.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Unfortunately (or very fortunately), my mother had 
some more unpleasant news for him. Mom has always had a real talent with
 a credit card. Due to the fact that we were living heavily in debt, she
 had quietly allowed Dad’s life insurance to lapse. His death would 
leave his wife and three young daughters destitute.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I imagine Dad was very angry. He had come to terms 
with dying, but this news surely obliterated any peace of mind he might 
have attained. At some point, he made the decision to do whatever he 
could to live. I don’t know from what source he found the strength to 
attempt the impossible. Maybe his anger provided the motivation. (After 
all, if he died, he wouldn’t be able to kill my mom!)</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Instead of tinkering with Twinkles, Dad now began 
tinkering with himself. The doctors had offered him no hope and no help;
 his only option was to take his case into his own hands. He wasn’t 
overly armed for the fight; one of his degrees is in biochemistry, and 
he knew of several people conducting innovative research in natural 
healing. His illness was so severe that, by trial and error, he was able
 to determine quickly what substances (food, vitamins, and/or minerals) 
swung the pendulum of his well being in what direction. Virtually 
everything the rest of the family ate would make him wretchedly ill. I 
remember sitting down to fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy 
while dad dined on vile-smelling liver. My sisters and I didn’t 
understand why he was eating this way; no one told us he was dying.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Anyway, Dad must have done something right. Two 
months came and went, and the next four followed suit. During this time 
(and for sometime after, to be sure), Dad was critically ill; and for 
the purposes of this paper and its space limitation, I have greatly 
simplified the things he did to get well. But the bottom line is still 
the same; he didn’t die.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Word got around — boy did it get around! The parents 
of Dad’s orthodontic patients started asking him for advice about their 
ills and those of their loved ones. And Dad naively dispensed it. I 
don’t believe it ever occurred to him to do otherwise. Many of those 
asking his advice were friends or, at least, people he knew. He simply 
told them what he had done to help himself. He had "been there" and knew
 first hand the agony a cancer patient experiences. Here were people in 
desperate need of help. If he knew something that might ease their pain 
at all, he felt it was his moral duty to tell them. And many of those 
who did what he said got well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">People came to see Dr. Kelley in increasing numbers, 
and they weren’t looking to have braces put on their kids’ teeth. Since 
he had to earn a living for his family but still felt a moral obligation
 to help anyone he could, he wrote a slim booklet in 1969 entitled <b><i>One Answer To Cancer.</i></b>
 In it was the story of his personal encounter with malignancy and the 
theoretical explanation of the procedures he used in getting well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">After the publication of <b><i>One Answer To Cancer</i></b>,
 things really started to happen. As you might imagine, the American 
Medical Association, the State Board of Dental Examiners, and a host of 
other health-oriented organizations began to get hostile. He endured a 
great deal of persecution during this time, and found himself in quite a
 dilemma. On one hand, the number of individuals seeking his help was 
ever increasing; on the other, charges of "practicing medicine without a
 license" were being leveled at him. Eventually, he began seeing cancer 
patients for a living and started charging for his services. However, he
 saw only those people whose doctors had referred their patients to him.
 He consulted with the individual as well as the physician involved, 
always working well within the law. At the last count with which I am 
familiar, he has worked with over 33,000 patients in this way.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley’s case load has always been predictably 
lopsided; until recently, the only patients who came to him did so after
 being advised that there was nothing left to do but buy their burial 
plots and make out their wills. They had tried everything else before 
coming to see him. It is really amazing that he was able to save any of 
them at all. A great many of those early patients are alive and well 
today, singing his praises to anyone who will listen. In the cases of 
those who he was not able to save, their quality of life was still 
drastically improved. Many who succumbed to their illnesses did so 
without the reality-distorting drugs they once took for pain relief. 
Noting this, many of their relatives became vocal supporters of my 
father’s work as well.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dad has helped blaze a trail; he has been a genuine 
pioneer in his field. I think the phrase "health food nut" must have 
been coined specifically to describe him. It is difficult now to 
remember how "far out" his concepts were considered in 1969. Just as 
women today take for granted the rights their forerunners worked so hard
 to win, it is easy to forget that Dad preached health foods and ecology
 long before it became "chic" to do so. When I was growing up, many of 
my friends asked me why I never had acne at all; I was too embarrassed 
to tell them. I must admit I am shocked to see things I was forced to 
consume and used to hide frantically (such as granola or carrot juice) 
not only socially acceptable but become socially desirable!</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">When friends came over to play with my sisters and 
me, there were no snacks we felt comfortable offering them. There was 
food in the house, to be sure, but nothing they might recognize. The 
milk in the refrigerator was raw goat’s milk (we had a goat in the 
backyard — that by itself caused a great deal of comment). My mother 
milled wheat to make her own flour to bake her own bread. Instead of 
sugar, the sweetener our family used was blackstrap molasses. Carob 
brownies are terrific, but if I offered them, I would have to explain 
that chocolate was not allowed in our house. People thought my parents 
were crazy, and I didn’t really disagree.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Moreover, it wasn’t just that we <i>ate</i> 
differently, Dad used the members of our family as guinea pigs to check 
out every new theory he came across in his research. For instance, he 
had all the silver fillings taken out of my mouth and replaced with 
gold. There had been quite a bit of silver in there, so the procedure 
took a long time and was very expensive. I didn’t understand why he 
wanted to do this, nor did I bother to ask for an explanation. Nothing 
Dad did at this time made sense to my sisters or me; we just rolled our 
eyes and did as we were told. Just within the last year, however, I have
 heard the news that the composition of silver fillings changes over 
time, sometimes producing the same symptoms as does mercury poisoning. 
This is just one example out of hundreds. I am still discovering on a 
daily basis just how much ahead of his time my father has been, and now I
 can appreciate the courage it must have taken to adhere to the truths 
he found.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Kelley has never refused any patient. His 
philosophy is: "Where there’s life, there’s hope." When actor Steve 
McQueen came to him for help, he did not turn him away although he knew 
that accepting the man as a patient was actually very dangerous. McQueen
 had a rare form of cancer, mesothelioma, which, to date, is always 
fatal. Again, he had been told to "get his affairs in order" by every 
physician he had seen; they offered him no hope. All the medical 
community could offer Mr. McQueen was a short delay of the inevitable by
 using surgery and chemotherapy. Steve McQueen was not unlike the rebel 
and the fighter he portrayed on-screen. Rejecting the concept of lying 
in a hospital bed, passively awaiting death, he preferred to fight to 
live, even in the face of odds no one could deny. Too, he had seen his 
friends (specifically, John Wayne) undergo the procedures the doctors 
recommended. He wanted no part of the slow, painful mutilation that held
 no hope of survival.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	The last thing anyone involved wanted was that the 
story of McQueen’s illness and subsequent treatment be leaked to the 
press. McQueen himself did not want the public to know he was ill; the 
people surrounding him did not want the star to be linked with the 
controversial treatment he was receiving. Dad didn’t want to go public 
with a famous patient whose chances of survival were so slim. He knew 
that if he lost a patient of McQueen’s stature, that particular death 
would be all the public would remember; the lives he had saved would be 
overlooked entirely.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">But that bastion of American Journalism, <b><i>The National Enquirer</i></b>,
 unearthed the story. Possessing an intense hatred for the tabloid, 
McQueen insisted that he be allowed to break the news before the <b><i>Enquirer </i></b>could go to press. He wanted to tell his fans about his illness himself.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">	Steve McQueen died November 7, 1980, from 
complications arising after surgery performed for the purpose of 
removing dead tumor masses.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">The majority of the media never did get the story 
straight. They had a field day with Dr. Kelley. I will never forget 
watching the <b><i>Today Show</i><font size="4"> </font></b>and seeing 
my father sit there, verbally brutalized by Tom Brokaw and Jane Pauley, 
watching him say virtually nothing in his own defense. He had known the 
probable outcome of the situation and took the abuse as if it were his 
due. In reality, all he had done was try, to the best of his ability, to
 help another human being who had no other avenue open. Tom Snyder gave 
him a fair hearing, and so did several others; but such was the 
exception, not the rule.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">Dad received a great deal of unexpected support from 
his old patients and their relatives, though; and I will never forget 
that either. He was swamped with their calls, letters, and gifts. They 
stood up to be counted; but, unfortunately, no one really cared about 
the lives Dr. Kelley saved — Steve McQueen was dead.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">I worked with my father at the International Health 
Institute, a privately owned foundation conducting research in natural 
healing. When people calling there discovered that my last name is 
"Kelley," I am in for an earful of praise for my father. They launch 
into hour-long dissertations about how wonderful Dr. Kelley is and how 
his work improved or saved lives of loved ones. It seems to be very 
important to these callers that Dr. Kelley’s daughter should understand 
and appreciate the magnitude of his work; they all take upon themselves 
the personal responsibility of informing me who he is and what he has 
done. He receives thousands of cards and presents each year from people 
he no longer remembers. They remember him, though; and they are grateful
 for his help.</p>
<p align="JUSTIFY">But no one is more grateful than I. My "healthy 
childhood" may have caused me a little embarrassment from time to time, 
but it has stood me in good stead. Dad has taught me to search for the 
truth, even if it means questioning what others readily accept. I will 
always be thankful that my father had the insight to find the truth, and
 the courage to say so.</p>
