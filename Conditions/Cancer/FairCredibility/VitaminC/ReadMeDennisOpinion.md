The main stream opinion about anything to do with Vitamin C, it that it is essentially hokum promoted by Linus Pauling. In my investigation this is unlikely to be the case.

Notes:
- Vitamin C generally refers to either L-Ascorbic acid or Sodium Ascorbate. Orally one can have either forms, though Sodium Ascorbate is gentler on the stomach. Intravenously it is _always_ Sodium Ascorbate + a smaller amount of other Ascorbates ( like Mg, Ca, K). The acid foom call kill if used intravenously.

- Dr. Fredrick R. Klenner  was one of  the  physicians who discovered that Vitamin C can work against a range of conditions: [http://www.doctoryourself.com/klennerbio.html](http://www.doctoryourself.com/klennerbio.html)

- Dr. Linus Pauling (of the Noble Laurate fame, who was as Phd not MD) worked with  Dr. Robert F. Cathcart on the treatment of cancer with Vitamin C.

- Linus Pauling has written several criticism of the failed Mayo Clinic Study. Overall it appears that his protocol was not correctly followed. Linus Pauling appears to be battling apathy or even hostility. Once cannot win such a battle. A video on the subject can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULTDEqWmQNw) and [here](https://www.facebook.com/vcfusa/videos/10155762378557953/)




Legitimate concerns about Vitamin C:
- [Ray Peat] (http://raypeat.com/) had once called up Linus Pauling after falling sick after having Vitamin C. Linus Pauling was dismissive of his concerns. According to Ray Peat the industrial process of making Vitamin C may contain huge amounts of heavy metal (lead) used as a catalyst in the manufacturing process.
- Vitamin C is generally consider to be an anti-oxidant. Exogenous antioxidants consumption is promoted as being good for one's health, but the opinion of those who looked at this closely is that, exogenous antioxidants are harmful because it disrupts the body finely tuned responses to endogenous antioxidants. My understanding - it was later found that Vitamin C is not entirely in the league of a conventional antioxidants because of it's other distinguishing features so it  not harmful compared to conventional antioxidants.
