Here are key things to be considered when mentioning diets:
--------------------------
- State percentage of people who will respond well to the 'diet' that you are talking about who _do not_ exercise but are fairly not sedentary. This figure need not be some official figure, your best guess is good enough. Tell us how you arrived at this best guess figure. Stating that people are different is not sufficient, you have to come up with some numbers.
- State percentage of people with chronic condition who respond well.
- Why do you think that some people do not respond to the diet? Are they not doing it correctly? Are they biologically different?
- What diets have you self-experimented with?
- Have you self experimented on the diet that you think does not deserve attention or you think is a fad. If you have not self experimented, why?
- specify exact foods and percentages that constitute the diet that are proposing. Mention  all foods, do not leave anything out.
- Are you (hypothetically) willing to place a bet, on the diet that you think will help with someone's health condition? 


Of the people who respond well, what are the measures of people who respond well?
As subjective as it may sound (as opposed to concrete well defined figures like cholesterol or sugar levels)) mention the following:
- How do they feel? Is it any different than when they were not on the diet.
- Do they sleep better?
- Do they have better motions?
- Do they have more energy?
- Do they have more/less visceral fat?
- Have they gained/lost weight?
- Does their skin do better/worse.
- Do they drink more water.
- Do they feel more hot/cold.
- Do they have vivid dreams.
- Is their libido better/worse

Things I would like the person to be aware of when discussing a diet topic:
---------------------------------------------------------------
-Evolutionary biology. Have you heard of the expensive tissue hypothesis?
Additive nature of certain foods, withdrawal symptoms. How would you distinguish craving for an additive food versus craving for a necessary food.
The general dogma/politics in science.
That good quality anecdotes are often better that 'studies'.
-Most studies are based on questionnaires.
- What is the evolutionary advantage for a carnivore over a herbivore, what are the disadvantages. What is the evolutionary advantages of an omnivore.
- The role of cooking. What foods are best cooked, what may be eaten raw?
- have you considered, what I call it the allergy/sensitivity. (Note: mainstream considers an allergy to be very different from a sensitivity, but here I have clubbed both together)
- Why do certain foods have toxins in them, eg certain fish, cassava, potato etc.
- are you aware of the Inuit paradox, French paradox and the Israeli paradox?

My allergy/sensitivity spectrum, in the order of increasing sensitivity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Red ruminant meat [least sensitivity]
- Eggs
- Fish
- Ripe sweet fruit
- Root vegetables(potato, cassava etc. in the cooked form)
- Shell fish, lobster etc.
- Vegetables (leaves, stem etc.)
-Nuts, seeds (includes rice, wheat, legumes etc.) [most sensitivity]
