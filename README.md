
What a typical listing of a  therapy/treatment should contain in plain English ( i.e not overly obscured by terminology and statistical jargon):

- A summary


- What is wrong with the mainstream approach? Why is this therapy/treatment a better alternative than what is the mainstream approach. Why are anecdote/approach of the mainstream approach wrong? (example, many vegans report feeling better when going off meat. What is actually happening is that they are going off many junk food that they may be eating, so it is not going off meat that is the source of better well being. The key here is people fail to take into account the various variables involved.)


- In what percentage of the population does it work and to what degree? Quantify it in simple numbers even if you do not have hard numbers. List the sources: 1) Personal experimentation 2) anecdotes from reliable others, papers. 3) An educated guess etc.  If you read a research paper quantify it in simple language. 

- who are the practitioners. Please put link and contact information.


- State actual results  not just numbers from blood work and other seemingly objective measures. example how the person feel, do they sleep better? do they feel more/less hungry, do they have more energy?  The reason being that numbers can be misleading. To give a good example the mainstream considers a high LDL to a high risk factor. 50% of people who do low carb diets have a high LDL but are overall doing great. This means that the assumption that  high LDL is a problem is incorrect in the first place.

- how long do the positive and side effects take, to show up.

- have you investigated the critiques of this treatment or drug, is the critism well found?

- have you investigated the history of this therapy/treatment

- have you considered placebo
